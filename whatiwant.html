<h2>What I want</h2>
<p>I want to discuss the state of the world, it's problems and possible solutions. Any and all.</p>
<p>I want it to be succinct. Speed beats everything else. Clarity. Truth. Notation.</p>
<p>I want it to be reasonably extremist and approach middle ground from there.</p>
<p>I want it to be as simply phrased and explainable as possible.</p>
<p>I want the discussion to happen in <a href="communication_is_hard.html#approachconclusion">this format</a>, or another one that's functionally the same. I don't care about the platform, I care about the methods. I think something like this format is necessary.</p>
<p>The core problem is utopia. Pick your version, think about it, think of the requirements to make it happen and we'll see what we can do.</p>
<p>Problems on the path to achieving it are sure to include issues like violence, inequality, freedom, justice and all the usual suspects.</p>

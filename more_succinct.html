<h2>
critical communication failure.
</h2>
<p>
If you have been linked here, there is a problem.
Someone did not get the information that is necessary for
something to happen. Or time was wasted on a non issue.
</p>
<p>
It might concern me, it might concern someone else and I am 
interested in the outcome. Or someone else found this applicable.
</p>


<h2>0. ideal situation</h2>
<p>
The ideal situation goes like this:
</p>
<ul>
<li>0.1 there is a problem</li>
<li>0.2 information about the problem is being shared</li>
<li>0.3 people can consume the information</li>
<li>0.4 draw conclusions</li>
<li>0.5 and start acting to solve the problem.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Any step of this process can fail. This has happened.
</p>


<h2>1. failure analysis</h2>
<p>
The way I approach Information I find is this:
</p>
<h3>1.1 relevance</h3>
<p>
The piece is <i>irrelevant and wasting my time</i> <b>unless</b>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>1.1.1 it concerns me personally</li>
<li>1.1.2 I can do something about the subject</li>
<li>1.1.3 it concerns my idealism of justice or correctness
and only when there is a major new development.</li>
</ul>
<h3>1.2. format</h3>
<p>I expect the piece of the information to
take my use of the information into account,
when the information is being compiled.
The piece should be tailored in such a way that I can easily find
 answers to my questions and reconstruct the ideas the author
  meant to imply.</p>
<p>I expect the piece to be </p>
<ul>
    <li>1.2.1 succinct</li>
    <li>1.2.2 indexed </li>
    <li>1.2.3 provide links and references</li>

</li>

</ul>
<h3>1.3.consequence</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1.3.1 if its a call to action I expect 
    <ul>
    <li>1.3.1.1 <i>actionable</i> information and instructions</li>
    <li>1.3.1.2 or a point of contact</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
 
<li>1.3.2 if its about an argument, I assume the author wants to
convince me or for me to convince someone else
using the piece as a resource.
<p>To do this need the information to be</li>
<li>1.3.2.1 reasonably complete</li>
<li>1.3.2.2 logically correct</li>
<li>1.3.2.3 grammatically correct and unambiguous</li>
<li>1.3.2.4 detail common ground</li>
<li>1.3.2.5 be "convincing"* or well sourced</li>
</ul>
<p>*convincing is circular here, but it's a catch all phrase
that makes sense in context.</p>
<h2>2. examples</h2>

<h3>2.1 elon musk and global hunger</h3>
<p>
Elon musk announced if the UN could provide a plan how to end world hunger,
he would sell tesla stock to make it happen.
</p>
<p>
The UN produced a two page document billing the cost at 2bil$
and stated that this would help a few countries listed
by name and some two dozen "others".
</p>
<p>
Elon musk did not sell stock and gave no money.
</p>
<p>
This topic concerns me, as it appeals to my empathy. I would like for
people to not starve. The UN failed to provide a detailed plan and 
an itemized bill. Their information:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>passes 1.1</li>
    <li>does not pass 1.2 and 1.3</li>
    <li>result: starvation, presumably</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.2 the 6th ippc climate report</h3>
<p>
I understand the UN climate report to be a
source of information relating to threat and
mitigation of climate change.
</p>
<p>
The topic concerns me personally, as I will be affected by climate 
change.
</p>
<p>
The report is split into multiple documents
the 2nd document is too long for me to consume and lacks formatting.
</p>
<p>
I can not take action on behalf of the issue or
possible solutions.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>passes 1.1</li>
    <li>does not pass 1.2</li>
    <li>1.3 can not be determined.</li>
    <li>result: risk of natural desaster.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. solution and prevention</h2>
<p>
This kind of problem occurs everywhere and all the time
I would like to take more action but I can not.
</p>
<h3>3.1 Quality Control Feedbackloop</h3>
<p>
The quality of information can be controlled
like any other variable. This is not done
enough. The way to do it is this:
</p>
<center>
<img src="./backmatter/full_feedback_ortho.svg">
</center>
<p>
Each part of the graphic should have a responsible person who can
be contacted asked to provide confirmation or details.
</p>
<p>
It should also be possible for any stakeholder to confirm any detail of any part 
of this at any time.
</p>
<p>
Repetition speed of the feedback loop is critical. Faster is better.
</p>
<h3>3.2 Planning</h3>
<p>
For the action part, a plan is required. A plan must contain:

</p>
<ul>
    <li>3.2.1.The objective</li>
    <li>3.2.2 Who is taking action</li>
    <li>3.2.3 What is to be done</li>
    <li>3.2.4 How much time is needed</li>
    <li>3.2.5 What the budget is</li>
</ul>
<h2>4. known Issues and warnings</h2>
<h3>4.1 the ideal situation is not realistic</h3>
<p>
It should be noyed that the ideal situation in 0.
is obviously not realistic but is still used as a
mental model by nearly everyone.
</p>
<p>
Meaning, just because a topic is well know, well
understood and recognized does not mean action will be
taken. Everyone still expects it to happen anyway. It does not.
</p>
<p>If you are about to take a large risk, please make sure you're not
relying on 0. to work.
</p>
<h3>4.2 creation and application</h3>
<p>I think it should be the responsibility of journalism and science
to provide better information. I don't think this is happening right now.
</p>
<p>I think it should be the responsibility of politics to act on good
information and to control the quality of the information provided to them.</p>

<h3>4.3 It's everywhere</h3>
<p>I have not seen a organization that actually takes their feedback
process seriously. Democracy, companies, social constructs.</p>

<h2>
critical communication failure.
</h2>
<p>
If you have been linked here, there is a problem.
Someone did not get the information that is necessary for
something to happen. Or time was wasted on a non issue.
</p>
<p>
It might concern me, it might concern someone else and I am 
interested in the outcome. Or someone else found this applicable.
</p>


<h2>0. ideal situation</h2>
<p>
The ideal situation goes like this:
</p>
<ul>
<li>0.1 there is a problem</li>
<li>0.2 information about the problem is being shared</li>
<li>0.3 people can consume the information</li>
<li>0.4 draw conclusions</li>
<li>0.5 and start acting to solve the problem.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Any step of this process can fail. This has happened.
</p>


<h2>1. failure analysis</h2>
<p>
The way I approach Information I find is this:
</p>
<h3>1.1 relevance</h3>
<p>
The piece is <i>irrelevant and wasting my time</i> <b>unless</b>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>1.1.1 it concerns me personally</li>
<li>1.1.2 I can do something about the subject</li>
<li>1.1.3 it concerns my idealism of justice or correctness
and only when there is a major new development.</li>
</ul>
<h3>1.2. format</h3>
<p>I expect the piece of the information to
take my use of the information into account,
when the information is being compiled.
The piece should be tailored in such a way that I can easily find
 answers to my questions and reconstruct the ideas the author
  meant to imply.</p>
<p>I expect the piece to be </p>
<ul>
    <li>1.2.1 succinct</li>
    <li>1.2.2 indexed </li>
    <li>1.2.3 provide links and references</li>

</li>

</ul>
<h3>1.3.consequence</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1.3.1 if its a call to action I expect 
    <ul>
    <li>1.3.1.1 <i>actionable</i> information and instructions</li>
    <li>1.3.1.2 or a point of contact</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
 
<li>1.3.2 if its about an argument, I assume the author wants to
convince me or for me to convince someone else
using the piece as a resource.
<p>To do this need the information to be</li>
<li>1.3.2.1 reasonably complete</li>
<li>1.3.2.2 logically correct</li>
<li>1.3.2.3 grammatically correct and unambiguous</li>
<li>1.3.2.4 detail common ground</li>
<li>1.3.2.5 be "convincing"* or well sourced</li>
</ul>
<p>*convincing is circular here, but it's a catch all phrase
that makes sense in context.</p>
<h2>2. examples</h2>

<h3>2.1 elon musk and global hunger</h3>
<p>
Elon musk announced if the UN could provide a plan how to end world hunger,
he would sell tesla stock to make it happen.

https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1454808104256737289
</p>
<p>
The UN produced a two page document billing the cost at 2bil$
and stated that this would help a few countries listed
by name and some two dozen "others".
</p>
<p>
Elon musk did not sell stock and gave no money.
</p>
<p>
This topic concerns me, as it appeals to my empathy. I would like for
people to not starve. The UN failed to provide a detailed plan and 
an itemized bill. Their information:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>passes 1.1</li>
    <li>does not pass 1.2 and 1.3</li>
    <li>result: starvation, presumably</li>
</ul>

<p>To add to this, I think Mr. Musk accurately predicted that the UN
woudln't be able to deliver this information. I don't think he actually
seriously intended to act on this. If he were that altruistic, he could
just invest his money to collect the informaiton himself and he doesn't
do that either.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the requested information wasn't given.</p>

<h3>2.2 the 6th ippc climate report</h3>
<p>
I understand the UN climate report to be a
source of information relating to threat and
mitigation of climate change.
</p>
<p>
The topic concerns me personally, as I will be affected by climate 
change.
</p>
<p>
The report is split into multiple documents
the 2nd document is too long for me to consume and lacks formatting.
</p>
<p>
I can not take action on behalf of the issue or
possible solutions.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>passes 1.1</li>
    <li>does not pass 1.2</li>
    <li>1.3 can not be determined.</li>
    <li>result: risk of natural desaster.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. solution and prevention</h2>
<p>
This kind of problem occurs everywhere and all the time
I would like to take more action but I can not.
</p>
<h3>3.1 Quality Control Feedbackloop</h3>
<p>
The quality of information can be controlled
like any other variable. This is not done
enough. The way to do it is this:
</p>
<center>
<img src="./backmatter/full_feedback_ortho.svg">
</center>
<p>
Each part of the graphic should have a responsible person who can
be contacted asked to provide confirmation or details.
</p>
<p>
It should also be possible for any stakeholder to confirm any detail of any part 
of this at any time.
</p>
<p>
Repetition speed of the feedback loop is critical. Faster is better.
</p>
<h3>3.2 Planning</h3>
<p>
For the action part, a plan is required. A plan must contain:

</p>
<ul>
    <li>3.2.1.The objective</li>
    <li>3.2.2 Who is taking action</li>
    <li>3.2.3 What is to be done</li>
    <li>3.2.4 How much time is needed</li>
    <li>3.2.5 What the budget is</li>
</ul>

<p>This information has to be as explicit and precise as possible.</p>

<h3>3.3 Delegation is no valid excuse</h3>
<p>Whoever is doing the delegating, is responsible for the information
to be collected, organized and made accessible and retrievable at any
possible time where that could be useful.</p>
<p>In other words, that "plausible deniability" is not possible.</p>

<h3>3.4 A lack of resources is no valid excuse</h3>
<p>
    If there are not enough resources, like time or money, ask for help, broadcast your need
    for assistance.
</p>
<p>
    If sufficient resources can't be mobilized, the problem actually isn't
    that important to people. See 1.3.2.
</p>
<p>
    If there are too many different topics in a schedule to get any
    single thing done, the issues need to be coordinated with other people.
</p>
<p>
    The amount of work necessary to deliver good information is fixed.
    There isn't necessarily a problem if somehting is work in progress, 
    there is a problem when "work in progress" is used as an excuse 
    to actually deliver any usable information.
</p>



<h2>4. manipulation and interconnection</h2>
<h3>manipulation is real</h3>
<p>
    Being pedantic about semantics isn't the goal, the goal is to
    deliver good information.
</p>
<p>
    Distraction, diversion, delaying, misrepresenation and faking information
    are all common practice. It is not fair to outright accuse people of it,
    in a "guilty until proven innocent" way, but "innocent until proven guilty"
    is too weak in practice as well.
 </p>
 <p>
     The point is, the "accusation" has to be possible and socially acceptable.
    The demand for good information, should not be met deflection, delegation
    ad hominem or "do it yourself then" responses.
</p>
 <p>
     Asking for sources and proof is the self defense mechanism against 
    manipulation and is in the interest of society in general. Respect it.
 </p>

<h3>4.2 independence is hard</h3>
<p>Independence is hard to achieve, given real world limitations.</p>
<p>Individuals can be intertwined with their subjects, through no fault
 of their own. As such, journalists and researchers who have specialized
  in certain areas shouldn't be thought of as independent
from their source of income or funding, or from frequented sources.</p>

<p>In other words, a journalist who has specialized in interviewing 
politicians, isn't independent of the subject. A scientist who has
built a career out of his subject being interesting and relevant, shouldn't
be trusted with evaluating whether that continues to be the case.</p>

<p>Public broadcasting institutions shouldn't be thought of as entirely
independent of the states that are financing them. There are hidden incentives
at play that make objective separation impossible.</p>

<p>These factors are the reason we want multiple sources that are independent
from each other, to be able to confirm the information and perspective
isn't influenced.</p>

<h2>5. known Issues and warnings</h2>
<h3>5.1 the ideal situation is not realistic</h3>
<p>
It should be noyed that the ideal situation in 0.
is obviously not realistic but is still used as a
mental model by nearly everyone.
</p>
<p>
Meaning, just because a topic is well know, well
understood and recognized does not mean action will be
taken. Everyone still expects it to happen anyway. It does not.
</p>
<p>If you are about to take a large risk, please make sure you're not
relying on 0. to work.
</p>
<h3>5.2 creation and application</h3>
<p>I think it should be the responsibility of journalism and science
to provide better information. I don't think this is happening right now.
</p>
<p>I think it should be the responsibility of politics to act on good
information and to control the quality of the information provided to them.</p>

<h3>5.3 It's everywhere</h3>
<p>I have not seen a organization that actually takes their feedback
process seriously. Democracy, companies, social constructs.</p>

<h2>x. I don't want a witch hunt, I want good information</h2>
<p>I'm not calling for resignation or apologies or law suits or punishments.</p>
<p>I can't deny I would find them enjoyable, but that's not the point.
It's important to stay focused and the focus is on good information, not
personal satisfaction.</p>

<h1>shape and content</h1>
<p>
    html and css tried to separate the content into html: answering "what is it?",headline, paragraph, picture and the data that makes up the content. And the look and formatting to css: "font, background, indents, etc."
</p>
<p>
    This was a good idea and a good approach, but formatting is done to communicate. It is also information and content or they carry meaning. 
</p>
<p>
    So there is some overlap between "real content" and "content that's in style".

<h2 id="research">research</h2>
<p>
    The choice of pdf and "publishing" in "journals" is a conscious one. In my opinion it's a bad one. The scientists involved have to pick something, but tradition doesn't absolve them of their responsibility to pick a good format to present their research in.
</p>
<p>
    Publishing or having published in traditional journals that are run for profit or aren't universally open access, is not defensible. People who do it are bad people. The damage they've done can be "undone" by decisive, public positioning against those journals and publishers and using their copyright to ask for depublication. Also naming and shaming of other researchers who hold other parts of the copyright, who refuse to use it for depublication.

<h2>languages shape thinking</h2>
<p>
For both natural languages and programming languages, the language we use shapes how we think.
</p>

<h3>natural language</h3>
<p>
E.g. in German which is a gendered language, the default for professions is male, which is a frequent point of conflict in public debate because the names of entire professions are either not PC, replacements are cumbersome and/or its not traditional.
</p>
<p>You can probably picture who argues for which side and why.</p>
<p>(personally I dont care and I'm fine with either)</p>

<h3>programming languages</h3>
<p>
For programming languages its actually really interesting who argues for which kind of expressions and where and why.
</p>
<p>
The difference between allowing features like GOTO or gow to handle whitespace is pretty big.
</p>
<p>
I am a big fan of python. I think it does a lot of things very well and enforces a good scaffolding for formatting and content.
</p>
<p>
I don't like several additions that weaken the implicit splicity of the syntax and some requirements for explicit actions.

<ul>
	<li>type hints
obviously stem from more C like minded programmers who panic at the thought of not being able to check things at compile time.
	</li>
	<li>list comprehensions and expressions and the walrus operator are put in by people who prefer to one-line things for some reason.</li>
</ul>

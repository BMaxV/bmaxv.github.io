first of all, words

newtonian physics is the school stuff.

movement of things, forces, bending things, most areas that deal with cars, planes, trains, electrical, most engineering or crafts is interested in these.

higher theoretical physics has a few problems.

the last somewhat conventionally easy to get thing is nuclear fission and fusion

tge things we see are "matter" and that matter isnt some blob or piece or liquid, its actually very small blocks called atoms that are made up of even smaller things called particles and different amounts of particles make, put simply "air", "metal" or "water".

a lot of energy is stored in atoms. this energy can be released by splitting an atom.

also, a lot of energy can be extracted when putting them together as well, because there are "leftovers" that dont fit the new atom and those shoot off at high speeds.

so far so good, and this is where physics stops "making sense".

worse until this point it can be reproduced and show in a class room or a university in a nearby city. it is " observable." (not really always but thats nitpicking)

the issue comes with the "why", we keep asking.

newtonian physics is reasonably good at predicting what is happening but not always why.

we can see that things have mass and that "gravity" moves them and falling things take time to reach the ground. we can describe how that works.

but we cant describe what "gravity" is beyond that very easily.

same for "time" "space" and "mass".

where do those come from?

the search for even smaller parts of atoms and the theories for that are in conflict with astronomy and cosmology. one very basic demand for natural laws and theories is that they have to be universal.

they have to work everywhere exactly the same, for all objects, be they atoms or galaxies.

observation of both big and small scale things since the splitting of the atom have motivated a lot of theories.

the scientists have a justification problem though.

it is fine to be curious, but the feneral justification for public funskng is that yhere is a public benefit. everyone chips in because eveeyone profits.

for theoretical physics this is not necessarily the case

the theories require a long time studying that most people cant afford even if they wanted to or could penetrate the complwx math.

it is also not producing remotely obvious benefits, at least not the same way it did in the past when it was about building better power plants or developing new avenues of power generarion, like solar cells.

me

this is not about you, its about me.

i like to think im not stupid.

if there is a reasonable chain of arguments im willing to slog througj and give it my best shot. and im also willing to admit that i am too stupid or too lazy.

but

most modern theories and publications are impenetrable.

not because they are difficult but the method and style they use to establish a chain of reasoning dont work. for me and there is a good chance its true for a lot of other people too.

current scientific authors reference papers that are inaccessible at some point down the chain. this chain of papers is also lacking any kind prioritisation which papers are more foundational or prerequisites.

it is possible that i would not understand the papers and the chain of thought if i could read them, but i cant read them.

therefore, from my perspective, those scientists dont fulfil their function very well of turning the unexplained into the explained.

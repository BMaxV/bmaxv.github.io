philosophy has a long and storied history, that can stand in the way of making it easy to understand and useful.

e.g. bertrand russels principia mathematica needs 250 pages or something to prove that 1+1=2 . i was never interested enough to read it.

kant said that you should live in a way where your actions could be reduced to a general rule everyone could live by.

he also said, "enlightenment is the exit from self inflicted... incompetence? immaturity? childish stupidity? naivitee?" its a bit iffy to translate.

then there are a bunch of philosophers who got and get sidetracked into basically esoteric stuff, like kierkegard.

what you should remember is that philosophy is the basis for organized thinking

language, grammar, logic are its tools.

math and science are advanced evolutions and consequences of using philosophy to learn to understand the world.

there is an xkcd called "purity" where it is expressed how mathematicians look down on less pure sciences.

the real joke is that of course philosophy is the most pure one and he just left it out of the picture. it is a bit silly, of course. but know your place. all you need to do to not feel inferior if thats a problem to you, is to just call yourself a philosopher as well.

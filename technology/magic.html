<h2>magic</h2>
<p>
    A technological book I really like, starts it's explanations with the 'perpetuum mobile', the machine that's impossible for physical reasons. It represents a ideal goal. Just the same, "magic" usually refers to the act of getting things done by easy, impossible, unexplained and unexplainable, not "natural" means.
</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
    "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."
</blockquote>

</div>
<h3>inverse definitions</h3>
<p>
    By combining this definition and the previous one about technology, we can clearly divide "what we can do" into two sets: the explained, explainable and reproducable being "technology", and every other action that does not have these qualities as "magic".
</p>
<h3>why is this important?</h3>
<p>
    "Magic" is <b>bad</b>.
</p>
<p>
    "Magic" that works without your understanding, can result in behavior and outcomes that you can't <i>predict</i> or <i>fix</i> or <i>revert</i>.
</p>
<p>
    There are also a lot of political reasons. It being unexplained usually means <i>someone else</i> hasn't explained the object <i>to you</i>. They are withholding information. If it's not <i>explainable</i>, messing with it is risky. That risk may becoime your risk and your problem. If it's not <i>reproducable</i>, the explanation that was given was <i>wrong</i> and the previous two problems exist.
</p>
<h3>consequence</h3>
<p>
    In a world filled with "unexplained technology"/"magic", we are facing a lot of... events? that are bad for the above reasons. It is in our interest, to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>understand them, to predict them and avoid bad outcomes, which can be <a href="science.html">"science"</a></li>
    <li>ensure that, even if we don't understand them, someone else, someone <i>benevolent</i> does and that someone should advise us how to deal with the thing or method at hand.</li>
</ul>
<p>How we get others to explain or handle the unexplained is a <a href="./../politics/index.html">political problem.</a></p>
</body>

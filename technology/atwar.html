as we grow, we leave a bubble of ignorance and constrcuted safe keeping.

safe keeping by our parents and to some degree otger actors and like schools ans govnernments.

we leave the bubble to find ourselves assaulted and at war.

gigantic behemoths, like cosmic horror entities are fighting over us, trying to dominate our opinion, spending habits and exploiting us as a resource.

to some degree, we can recreate safe spaces and retreat into vacation, immersive media experiences or other distractions, but overall the spell is broken.

everyone who realizes this, is forced to make a choice for themselves: submit or fight. if you fight you should educate yourself on how to do that better than cyber chtulu.

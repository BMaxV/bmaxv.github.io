so...

basically whats a good way to calculate these.

the basics is of course that

in flow of money - out flow of money = profit

but the joke is that profit is also an outflow.

really its more like

[inflow] - [ "cost" + "profit" ] = 0

<h2> cost </h2>

cost is traditionally, normally, expenses you have to pay to achieve whatever it is you want to do.

like the price of the material, energy to build somethint.

when it comes to wages, they are trafitionally alsonthought of as "cost" but thats not 100% consistent, because a wage is just whar someone has *negotiated* its not actually, rock bottom bare metal what that person needs. it actually includes their profit as well.
<br>
so in terms of thinking about an organization, to really optimize, it would be more helpful to write the equation like this:

[inflow] - [necessary expenses of the company + necessary expenses of the employees] - [ profit for the owner + profit for the employees ]

because this presents a more accurate picture of what is "negotiated market advantage" and what is "rock bottom where  the company as an organization of people HAS TO shut down because production is no longer possible.

honorable mention,taxes, "fees" for insurance and public transport required to get to the place of employment, union fees are costs thar are necessary doe the operation of tge whole and are to be oncluded in the "cost" part, not the profit/wage part.

<h2> wage relations </h2>

its a frequent talking point that ceos earn 200x 400x more than lowesr employees.

the question is here what is a fair wage, and whats a "motivating wage"

the roman army operated in multiples of 0.5. 

so the next higher rank or people with important duties would earn 1.5x or 2x more.

i think this is a good starting point.

see wikipedia.

another book about telecommunications also listed the wage of an overseeing officer as 2x.

so, lets look at some skill levels and difficulty of education.

at some point were ar 

1x: simple in-door, not customer facing desk work.

1.5x this is for any unskilled labor, shoveling dirt, delivering letters, pizza

2x overseeing either of such labor
2.5x similaf skilled labor, like an educated carpenter
4x master carpenter who can run a company has like 5-10 employees, oversees results but is also responsible and liable for delivering the promised quality.

-------

this category of jobs needs to be high paid, because the goal should be the creation of new companies. not just cornershops, barbers etc. but companies that lay the gdoundwork for new multi nationals.

the wage is not just meant as motivation, its also the method of delivering captial to those with big expected expenses.

7x high quality but not creative, working according to set rules and guidelines

10x creative productive person (there are only like 10 of these even in big companies.

creative engineers who decide what a product might be
creative directors who set the tone, approve or disapprove of 

writers of laws
doctors


11x leader of research projects

----------

20x leaders of nations
multinational ceos

end of the spectrum

<h2>life upkeep.</h2>

im estimating life upkeep at 0.5 to 0.8 of the wage. with a normal job being 30 hours a week.

<h2>shortage</h2>

if a shortage is declared,

the wage for that particular work increases 0.5 per year until the shortage is over. this ignores other usual boundsriws.

an important factor in science and reporting is "independence"

thats because of objectivity and the goal to reach a consensus and "fact" through different observations that do not interfere with each other.

the problem is, when the scope of the system we're talking about is bigger than one experiment or observation, it is not possible or useful to uphold this.

newspapers are independent in the sense that they can be owned and written by different people, but they very much rely on the same environment, fovernment, etc..

to claim a international organization is independent is thus mostly wrong, because they do depend kn the nations they operate in and the nationality and behavior of the people acting in it.

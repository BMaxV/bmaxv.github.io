<h2>the political superlative</h2>
<p>
In regular logic we try or we must describe things accurately. In politics, its much more free form. an aspect that deserves a highlight is the political superlative:
<blockquote>
There is no other way
<br>
we must do [X]
</blockquote>
<p>
Which always strictly false, but is sufficiently meaningful in its context.
</p>
<p>
The full sentence is always " [given our set of morals, laws, internal rules, the current political climate, our personal or collective history of decisions, and external restrictions such as resources and alliances, we can't choose an alternative and therefore] we must do this."
</p>
<p>
The same principle applies for "there is no justification", which is also always wrong. A justification can be non sequitor, wrong, not fit, be silly, in a different language. But only beings that are not self concscious or unliving things lack "justification". But even they have causal relationships.

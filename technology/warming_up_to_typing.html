<p>
So... I had a case of... "nested type hell"
and something didn't work because I was trying to access it in the wrong way
</p>

<p>
and I guess the interesting bit is that even if it had been "typed"
that wouldn't have helped, because the breakdown of the type is what
I wanted, not just the naming.
</p>

<p>
static typing carries the assumption that just because something is
named, the reader is fully able to then handle the object.
</p>

<p>
but that is not something guaranteed by the typing system.
</p>

<p>
I would actually like something like a "type workbench" that allows
me to inspect a variable / type and deep dive into how to access
parts of it.
</p>

<p>
So, "describing the type" and "giving more type information" is a possible
helping element, but the way it is done at the moment isn't the way
I would want it to be done.

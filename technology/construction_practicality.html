construction practicality

there is the ideal of logic deduction and reduction to simple causes and simple relatuonships.

ideally one can explain situations as combinations if environment circumstances and applicable natural laws.

to understand how the wolrd works it would seem to be desorable to learn all sets of circumstancea and all sets of rules.

in practice, thats not feasible:

learning has dependencies, things have to be taught in order aometimes
the total ampunt of sets of environemnt and swts of rules is too bog, we need to take shortcuts or ignore areas that are not of immediate interest.
learning takes time, we have to prioritize between learning and actually doing things. formulating theory has an opportunity costs

interestingly there are rules of thumb that have emeeged thar are strangley transferable but "weak" and "imprecise".

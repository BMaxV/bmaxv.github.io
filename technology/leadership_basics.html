<h2>leadership basics</h2>
<p>
I think leadership is a very simple thing to a degree.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>part of it is just managing some numbers.</li>
	<li>part of it are some principles.</li>
	<li>part of it is articulation and negotiation.</li>
	<li>part of it is some amount of actual expertise, maybe, hopefully. Depends on the subject.</li>
</ul>
<p>
But the amount of information you really need to know to lead, is small. It's much more about daring to do it and daring to learn a few lessons.
</p>
<p>
	Meaning, there are different phases to learning what leadership is and how it works:
	
<ol>
	<li>There is a phase where you know nothing, you can't see or distinguish good or bad leadership.</li>
	<li>Then there is a short phase of learning, which can be informal. Nothing will teach you as quickly and effectively about bad leadership as having to suffer from it.
	</li>
	<li>
	Very quickly after that is near complete understanding, where further study will not help you much.
	</li>
</ol>

<p>
The difference between a guy managing 5 people at a cornerstore and a multi billion CEO can be very small. The rest is up to people skills, recognizing qualities, wants, needs, difficulties, people who need support but dont say so, people who ask for support but are actually fine on their own.
</p>
<p>
That is a very soft skill that cant be learned from books

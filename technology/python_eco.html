this is a pretty good article on tge problematic situation of distribution and packaging.

let me preface that by restating the desired ideal state:

all software is supposed to work.

without conflict

on the newest versions

in harmony.

original package managers tried to do tbis with dependencies.

this no longer works if devs pin their version in tgeor package.

(note: write a tool that checks this.)

it also somewhat fails if a user wants to install a specific oyher version

imo this should be solved by turning "import" into a function with an optional argument specifying another version that last LTS.

meaning i dislike all the tools venvs other managers, pinning etc. because they are impure by design.

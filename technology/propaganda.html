when mentioning propaganda, the image that is conjured might be that of a smart orator using lingering feelings, racism, tribalism, secterian conflicts to achieve some motivational purpose.

its about framing of stories, putting emphasis on parts that are in the interest of the speaker or author, and deemphaziing the parts that are not serving the cause.

to sum it up: exploiting human nature with simple images and narratives to achieve some purpose.

objectively wrong stories.

however

there is another kind. you can just use accurate data, and target smart people as well.

you pretend the data says exaxtly what you want it to say and if the audience isnt... thinking for themselves...

wow this sounds like the cheapest, stupidiest description. whats next, "wake up sheeple"?

Anyway, my point.

there are modern, popular authors that promote certain ideas that are then in turn promoted by an industry that percie es jr would be helped by those ideas being popular.

"factfullness" author is a swedish? norwegian? doctor who has released a book avout how the world in general is really doing a lot better than 50 years ago.

as well as the UN pretending that people no longer living on 50cwnts a day but 1$ is a "major gain" and really we zhpuldnt be doom.and gloom and praise our wise leadership.

these books are important reference points because the author and the target audience are on the smart part of the bell curve.

they are to be studied but caeefully and under constant reminders thar the data that is presented in near academic dress is not to be trusted at face value.

in logic any sequence of words or sybomls forms a sentence.

if all parts of a sentence are true, the sentence is true.

given an infinite amount of sentences, many mean the same thing.

were trying to find the smaller or smallest sentences that are srill true.

as many as possible and hopefully all of them.

also preferably in an order that makes sense.

so, information is werid.

lets start with a simple boolean:
(1)
we know that newtons physics work, e.g.
<pre>
f=m*a this true
</pre>
(2)
and we know that the statement that it doesn't work is false
<pre>
f!=m*a this is false
</pre>
these we know for certain

then there is uncertainty
(4)
information can be too vague later in, "later today" vs. "later this century"
(3)
it can be in an unknown area, like a different language
(5)
and it can be weird

when this happens we are uncertain which case it is.
(6)
is it our fault, are we too stupid to understand?
(7)
is the source of the information wrong?
(8)
was there no aerious attempt at communication and it's just some gaga or dadaist stuff?

there are also spaces of weirdness and suspension of disbelief.

if the context is a scifi atory with aliens, one more variety of alien appearing on stage is less weird than in a story that previously had no aliens in it.

the same way other strongish differences in quality, like above average specificity are weird.

although that's probably in an area of "how to doubt"

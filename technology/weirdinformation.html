So, information is weird.
</p>
<p>
lets start with a simple boolean:
</p>
<p>
(1)
we know that newtons physics work, e.g.
</p>

<pre>
f=m*a this true
</pre>

<p>
(2)
and we know that the statement that it doesn't work is false
</p>

<pre>
f!=m*a this is false
</pre>

<p>
These we know for certain. Then there is uncertainty:
</p>

<p>
(4)
information can be too vague later in, "later today" vs. "later this century"
</p>
<p>
(3)
it can be in an unknown area, like a different language
</p>
<p>
(5)
and it can be weird
</p>
<p>
when this happens we are uncertain which case it is.
</p>
<p>
(6)
is it our fault, are we too stupid to understand?
</p>
<p>
(7)
is the source of the information wrong?
</p>
<p>
(8)
was there no aerious attempt at communication and it's just some gaga or dadaist stuff?
</p>
<p>
There are also spaces of weirdness and suspension of disbelief.

If the context is a scifi story with aliens, one more variety of alien appearing on stage is less weird than in a story that previously had no aliens in it.

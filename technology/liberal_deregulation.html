<h2>"liberal" "deregulation"</h2>
<p>
    The "free market" wants to "deregulate", to consciously use bad and dangerous and deadly methods, to extract more money from people.
</p>
<p>
    There is no other reason than greed.
</p>
<p>
    They have done it since age immemorial.
</p>
<p>
    People proposing deregulation of safety standards in particular, but almost all regulation anyway, are doing so for unironically <b>evil reasons</b>.
</p>
<p>
    Link here in case of "someone asking for deregulation" and send me examples to add to the list..
</p>

<h2>examples</h2>
<p>
    Famously, they put sawdust into bread. Like <b>50-75%</b>. It killed people.
</p>
<p>
    In more recent news, the operators of the "titan" submarine that was crushed by natural laws of gravity and pressure and killed 5 people, thought they could get away with building an unsafe vehicle, skipping safety tests and charging 250.000$ per person, per trip.
</p>
<p>
    (the implosion also killed the passengers).
</p>
<p>
    This will always happen.
</p>
<div><h2>the grain of salt</h2>
    <p>
        If all we ever did was create more regulation, obviously we would drown in it eventually. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Rest assured though, that a believable call for having "too much burocracy" will come from: citizens, students, burocracy itself. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Most relialistically, there will be a crisis and <b>self interest to reduce work load</b> that will reveal truly excessive regulation. Once public attention is on the subject, it is easy to find a new regulation and work flow, without compromising the original goal of safety.
    </p>
    <p>
        Companies will ever only want to remove obstacles that were specifically put into place to stop them from harming society at the cost of society, but for the benefit of the company.
    </p>
</div>
<div><h2>category</h2>
<p>
    This is here because it's a <b>method</b> "liberals" try to use to get more money out of whatever they're trying to do it. It's a tactic. That puts it in "technology" category.
</p>

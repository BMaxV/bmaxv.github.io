to operate things has requirements, such as an engine requiring fuel.

if our entire society and economy has a multitude of things it requires, and it is technologically advancing at the same time, it may be possible to advance to a state where more things and some simpler things are required that are no longer veing produced  by society, because the production was peeceived as "low value".

e.g. telephone disinfection i suppose.

if these "simple things" are immaterial, it is possible to reach a state of... using physical metaphors, going uphill too fast and losing ground contact on bumps or such.

for example, i dont trust the current government to pursue a nd create a "basic security". the basic security we enjoy is a product of education and a lack of criminal energy.

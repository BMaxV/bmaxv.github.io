<div><h2>failure culture is hard.</h2>

when i worked in an industry job, i found it very refreshing that reporting speed and recognition of the issue and a speedy solution was the most important part.

every delay would cause more cost.

responsibility and causation was secondary.

naturally there are also cases when causation is incredly important to prevent a repetition of the event.

leaders are nominally responsible for the instruxtions they give and the workers they instruct.

at the same time they want to have a stable job and that includes flawlessness or at least blamelessness.

naturally the interest to avoid blame and the interest to achieve speed are at odds.

<p>
I have wondered before if it is possible at all, to report or point out failure due to incompetence while staying nominally polite. I dont think it is possible.
</p>
<p>
What we need is the humility to accept mistakes and to not clutch responsibility and authority (and compensation) when it is clear that the person or group cant do their responsibility justice.
</p>
<p>
What we need in particular is to remove incompetent people from a chain of command or approval who dont help progress or solve issues. Helping issue can come in the form of data of "it doesnt work for me".
</p>
<p>
since it seems unavoidable to be rude, i dont think anyone needs to hold back with accusations, particularly if it concerns public or semi public interests.

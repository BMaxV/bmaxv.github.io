<h2>group building</h2>
<p>
i think we collectively lack experience or a manual/guideline to form effective social groups.

i observed this in mmos where players/gamers gather to achieve a common purpose, but even there, some people "sacrifice" for the group and take it upon them to organize.
</p>
then the workload exceeds their "budget" and they burn out.
<p>
in case of games, sometimes someone new steps up and tge cycle repeats or the group dissolves. both are bad.

the same pattern can be ovserved in political parties or companies with the difference that polirical activism is done because its "right" but its not fun and corporate activity is paid for.
</p>

so the motivation pattern ranges from slightly to very different. i sgould put a table here
<table>
<tr>
games			political		corporate
</tr>
<tr>
fun			obligation		money
</tr>
<tr>
pseudo material reward	self actualization	self preservation
</tr>
<tr>
social experience	justice
</tr>
</table>
<p>
ideally, the workload of "doing for the group" could be tracked to ensure a roughly equal workload, measure effort/performancd, to make sure that everyone participates and feels integratex, that there are no free loaders taking undue leadership positions, to track achievements and use them to justify meritocratic leadership or opinions.
</p>

doing this is a broader general.problem that has several
sub problems:
<div>
	<h2>group identity</h2>
	<p>formulating and communicating group identity and goals, theory</p>
	<p>
managing the group, including moderatuon/policing
practice of day to day operations
	</p>
<p>
recruitment and social mobility
</p>

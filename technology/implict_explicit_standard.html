<h2>explicit vs. implicit</h2>
<p>
You can write things that are coincidentally conforming to a standard like 2024 12 24 describing the 2rth of decemver accirding to the iso 8601 standard. Or we can write things explicitly.
</p>

<pre>
hello this the <dateiso>2024-12-24</dateiso> and we are celebrating christmas.
</pre>

<p>and while it is slightly more effort to do this, it enhances the quality of the text and the data a lot. theoretically we could now interpret things client side and display the date however we want.</p>

<p>obviously this is currently not being done.</p>

i have noticed that while simple populist explanations are often poetrayed as irrational, oversimplified or a class boundry violation (e.g. you are not a member of the "scientist/political class, so your input is invalid"),

big populist critique is what we have idolized and in retrospect can identify as bog turning points in human society.

catholic church popularzing a religion of ideals, of kindness and god given laws, possibly in opposition to greek/roman gods who more haphazardly did things.
martin luther pointing out the disconnection of the supposed mission of the church and the actual actions of abusing the ideal for personal and institutional profit.
francis bacon, who pointed out that the previous attempts at "finding out how things work" were unreadable and dogmatic.

and also, phrasing a commoly perceived issue in a splified way that can be agreed to by lots of people, a certain "common ground making" seems to be basis for a general consensus, some specialisation and ultimately action by a lot of people.

so a big systematic critique should be short and generally correct, over detailed and difficult to access.

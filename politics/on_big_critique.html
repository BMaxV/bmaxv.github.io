<h2>simplified critique is good</h2>
<p>I think there is a general consensus that "oversimplification is bad" and "expert opinion should be given priority".</p>
<p>
I have noticed that while simple, populist explanations are often portrayed as bad, irrational or a class boundry violation (e.g. you are not a member of the "scientist/political class, so your input is invalid"), big populist critique is what we <b>have done in the past, we have idolized it</b>. And in retrospect, points of voicing certain simplified critique, can be identified as big turning points in human history:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The catholic church popularzing a religion of ideals, of kindness and god given laws, possibly in opposition to greek/roman gods who more haphazardly did things. 
<br>Martin Luther pointing out the disconnection of the supposed mission of the church and the actual actions of abusing the ideals for personal and institutional profit.
</li>
<li>
	Francis bacon, who pointed out that the previous attempts at "finding out how things work" were unreadable and dogmatic.
	<br>
	The "royal society" of the UK forming a scientific group because he was sort of right and trying to use his approach.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Phrasing a commoly perceived issue in a simplified way that can be agreed to by lots of people, a certain "common ground making" seems to be basis for a general consensus, some specialisation and ultimately action by a lot of people.
</p>
<p>
So a big systematic critique should be short and generally correct, so that it can be easily agreed upon, rather than exactly correct, detailed but difficult to access.

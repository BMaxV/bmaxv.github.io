so, there is some traps and stigma with big sweeping ideas.

some.real problems too.

mostly, they look simple and reality is not simple. then again sometimes reality is very simple too.

anyway, i think the realistic failures and threats shouldnt stop anyone from dreaming unrealistically big.

annunrealistic goal can still be productive. some.changes aee not incremental and if they were they would be so small to be demotivating. we xant have that.

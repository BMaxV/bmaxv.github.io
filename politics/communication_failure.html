<h1>Communication Failure</h1>
<p>
    If I make an argument, in a language you don't speak, you will fail to understand it.
</p>
<p>
    Is that your fault for not knowing the language, or mine for not accomodating you?
</p>
<div><h2 id="superiority"><a href="#superiority">[l]</a>Superiority</h2>
<p>
    If what you want to gain from an exchange is a feeling of superiority, you can have that.
</p>
<p>
    E.g. "[math] q.e.d. I got mine, if you don't get it, that's <i>your</i> problem."
</p>
</div>
<div><h2 id="cooperation"><a href="#cooperation">[l]</a>Compromise and cooperation</h2>
<p>
    If what you want to gain from an exchange is cooperation and help through insight, you need to make a <b>good, working appeal</b>, and the other person <b>needs to agree</b> with you.
</p>
<p>
    E.g. "If you don't get it, it's <i>our</i> problem."
</p>
</div>
<div><h2 id="overruling"><a href="#overruling">[l]</a>Overruling</h2>
<p>
    If what you're doing is merely a hopefully informative or official statement informing other people of your intention, action or reasoning, without the need for feedback... Don't be surprised if they don't react nicely.
</p>
<p>
    E.g. "As your ruler, I am informing you of our action X, your understanding or coopration is not required."
</p>
</div>
</body>

all i really want is for society to be
<ul>
	<li>meritocratic</li>
	<li>rational in its decisions</li>
	<li>equalizing where possible</li>
	<li>tolerant of diverging opinions</li>
</ul>
it is a free association of free individuals, agreed upon to organize and enable common goals and interests.
</div>

<div>
this has several implicit consequences and requirements and other aspects that need clarification:

<div>
human nature and more specifially history has taught us, that single humans can not be trusted with power.
<p>
therefore we  need democratic, group and vote based decision process to mitigate individual influence and represent different opinions on matters that dont have immediately available or obvious conclusions.
</p>
<p>
we need to exclude the possibility of several decisions from being made at all, like the death penalty.
</p>
<p>
It has historically also been the case that some individuals have exceptionally high skill, exemplary morals and timley initiative. They defy preemptive definition, so that a codified exception cannot be made, but one should be thereoretically available. A most fitting, recent example would be george washington who rejected the totalitarian power that was offered to him. also the mayor of hamburg who ordered the military to help in time of natural disaster, which was nominally not allowed at the time.
</p>
</div>
<div>
continued existance of such a society requires several affairs to be organized:
	defense of the interests of the group and each individual
	an organized method of education and recruitment for the various work that society requires.
	taxes to pay for common goals and investments
	a separation of powers to organize these.

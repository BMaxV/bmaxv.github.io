with corruoption and the fighting of that corruption

 there is a certain dance/play to it.

 first of all, everyone pretends to be righteous and honest, and everyone pretends that everyone believes that to be true as well.

then there is an obvious case of suspect behavior.

the lawful corrective element will then pretend that this id only a mistake and ask for the correction and sometimes compensation.

the criminal/corrupt element will then either pretend that no rule violation has taken place or claim it was accidental.

with legislative there comes another level, because they make the rules themselves and all consequences are hypotheticals.

also, if the hypothecial is bad enough, reverting can become.imoossible. this can be called a coup.

if a coup is prevented all associated people will disavow their association, claim to be unaware of the attempt.

this is where documents and other records are interesting and relevant becazse they are supposed to prove association or awareness.

therefore, the disappearance of documents and photos is always a sure indicator that someone is trying tk cover their awareness and association tracks they could be accused for, if knowledgr about their actions were to become common

<br>

on a next level we can look at and collect data about possibility space.

how likely is it that some number x of y is doing itnetionally with the goal of a coup?

how likely is it that some number z of y is so stupid and ignorant they dont notice their peers preparing a coup?

this where i dont like hanlons razor as an excuse.

all groups have the recruitment and onboarding problem.

be it because of members leaving or aging and eventual death of members, if there is an interest to keep the group alive for longer than the membership of the some original members, new members.have to be found, educated or tested, motivated to join the group, etc..

with the growth of groups, the administrative workload increases and even if a certain setup works for a small group, that setup will fail eventually.

this means:

the nature and bevahior of the group has to be communicated to new members somehow.

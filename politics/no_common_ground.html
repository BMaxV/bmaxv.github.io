<h2>no common ground</h2>
<p>
    Something that can be observed regularly in discussions, is that people are talking and they are not actually sharing common ground.
</p>

<center>
<div style="width:50%;">
<pre style="text-align:left;">
    >>> position A
</pre>

<pre style="text-align:right;">
    something unrelated, not position A <<<
</pre>

<pre style="text-align:left;">
    >>> position A + concession A.1
</pre>
</div>
</center>

<p>
    This is somewhat relating to the technologies of how to talk and make arguments, but I think more than that, it's a social / political failure on part of the person of the left. A failure to recognize that "discussion" isn't happening and that the other person being talked to, has abandonned the concept of discussion, discourse, compromise and cooperation.
</p>
<p>
    They are sitting at the negotiation table, not to reach a deal, but to deceive and to delay and to distract you from taking measures that will enforce or enable discussion.
</p>
<p>
    You may think it's still a question of compromise and are offering concessions and cooperation on other topics. This will not work and only increase your losses.
</p>
<p>
    Examples of this are topics like
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The debate about weakening encryption of private communication and "compliance with laws and rights" in the EU <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM%3A2022%3A209%3AFIN&qid=1652451192472">(link to the documents)</a>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>the actual purpose is surveilance and oppression of citizens</li>
        <li>it's giving a pretense purpose ('preventing child abuse')</li>
        <li>there are no public negotiations about the purpose.</li>
    </ul>

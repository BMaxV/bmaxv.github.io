<h1>Jeff Bezos' Reply</h1>

Jeff Bezos wrote <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/10/28/jeff-bezos-washington-post-trust/
">this article</a> in response to an "outcry" at the whashington post not making a presidential endorsement.


I am actually very interested in what Jeff Bezos has to say, because in that paper, his opinion is actually the only opinion that counts.

And also, events where these kinds of billionaires actually publish a somewhat coherent piece of text are rare.

It is important to counter each point individually to point out, not just that he is wrong, but *how* he is wrong.

Being wrong is the important deciding factor why human society has gotten rid of aristocracy and why we don't look favorably on dictatorships.

What presidential endorsements actually do is create a perception of bias. A perception of non-independence. Ending them is a principled decision, and it’s the right one. Eugene Meyer, publisher of The Washington Post from 1933 to 1946, thought the same, and he was right.

    <li>Yes, they do.</li>
    <li>No it isn't.</li>
    <li>The opinion of an American publisher in 1933 to 1946 is meaningless.</li>

</ul>
<p>
Because newspapers are depending on the shape of society around them.

Maybe if we had more journalists speaking out against the Nazis <b>in 1930, to 1933, Germany,</b> people wouldn't have elected Hitler. The journalists with the wrong opinions then maybe would not have been rounded up, and killed in the holocaust. Speaking out and being allowed to speak out, is a form of self defense for some people.

I would also like to be clear that no quid pro quo of any kind is at work here. 
</td>
<td  class="block">
That's not necessary for the dynamic to work. If you're top 10 rich people of the world rich, you don't need to pay anyone in particular or get any money from anyone in particular to profit.

The point of owning a media (for a capitalist) is to shape reality and through that shaping of reality, increase profits.

Yes, but again, the point is profit. If it gets a little bit more complicated but you're also making more money, that's not in conflict.

 I assure you that my views here are, in fact, principled, and I believe my track record as owner of The Post since 2013 backs this up.

Even if they are <b>principled</b> I don't have to share the opinion and agree with those principles. Believability doesn't stem from principles.

You are of course free to make your own determination, but I challenge you to find one instance in those 11 years where I have prevailed upon anyone at The Post in favor of my own interests. It hasn’t happened.

It did, refusing to allow the news paper to make an endorsement is that event.

Lack of credibility isn’t unique to The Post. Our brethren newspapers have the same issue. And it’s a problem not only for media, but also for the nation.

Many of the finest journalists you’ll find anywhere work at The Washington Post, and they work painstakingly every day to get to the truth. They deserve to be believed.

Maybe they do deserve to be believed and maybe they don't. That's not really the point or the accusation though. The fault wasn't with the journalists.

<h2>so what's happening here?</h2>
<p>Is he not aware of it? Did he misunderstand? Is this just a PR piece?</p>
<p>Maybe he didn't understand a few core principles of what truth and believability are?</p>
<p>Maybe he didn't write it at all, and this is a text written by some poorly paid intern that he slapped his name on, in an attempt to appease the enraged public? Would that even be a good strategy? How much pride does he have, would that be too low for him?</p>

clearly there are systems and actions we do control

and there are systems and consequenxes we dont control

if we believe jn personal responsibilty and
and we are not in control of something and thats
causing a consequence we dont like
we have the responsobilty to take control of that
system

and change it in a way that it no longer produces the outcome

we dont like.

otherwise we would be not taking an action we can take to prevwnt a bad outcome.

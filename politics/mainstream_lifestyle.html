sitting in airplane, browsing the shopping offerings,

im wondering what makes this pseudo mainstream appealing.

it would be interesting to try to popularize, efficient and effective living. this is being done with bicycles, but it can probbaly be done with "living rooms" "family eating" and such as well.

there is no particular point to an individual home with cross invitations for the purpose of minor social interaction and "stroking"?

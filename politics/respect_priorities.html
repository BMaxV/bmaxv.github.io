one part of why i think its difficult for the left to form a sort of unified group is thar its members cant manage to respect other splinter groups priorities and tolerate disagreement for the sake of achieving their own goals.

they would rather remain morally pure in some way than achieve a partial success.

e.g. 

if there are two splinter groups and one is feminist and wants equal pay and the other is against immigration of low skill workers becazse they threaten the job security of domestic low skill workers,

they need to recognize that their common ground isi the pay topic and they should recognize that its necessary to ignore their disagreement over immigration or other feminist goals if they want to fight for their wage target.

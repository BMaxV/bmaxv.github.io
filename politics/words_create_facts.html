when talking about politics or "the world"

its spoken or believed words that create the "true state" of the world.

if "the people" say that a country is ruled justly, THAT is the truth.

you can try to change that opinion through force, panem et circenses or a clever argument, but there should be no doubt about the basis of things.

this is why its incredibly important to make statements that are easy to understand, short enough to be listened to and easy to accept or reject.

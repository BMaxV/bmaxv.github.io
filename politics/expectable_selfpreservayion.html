a case for a reasonable expectation of self preservation.

shoving someone and him falling down is bad and your fault.

shoving someone and then 40 million people falling over like dominoes because they put absolutely no effort into standing, is maybe not entirely your fault.

telling them to brace for a test, including accurate detaild.for strength, them answering ready and them then still falling over when pushed, should not be your fault.

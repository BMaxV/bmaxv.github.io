 one open question thats occaduonally in tge news is how much migration should take place, who should be helped, internationally, who sgould be accepted under assylum rules.

part of the problem with that discussion lies with the main motivation of two participating groups:

1.one position makes an argument for compassion and freedom

2.one position makes an economical argument that "workers are needed for the economy". 
2.1companies make the argument thwt it may be cheaper to attract people from ozzer places than training new pepple.

they are somewhat at odds with one another.

the opposition is composed of two factors:

3.isolationist people want to be left alone, dont want to welcome new people and tgerefore dont want to help and then integrate people. there is also so xfear of crime and conflicts with other cultures.

4. economic protectionist people fear the impact that more workers have on the economic value of work. theirs or the total work.

common patterns.

2.1 is bad for the society it takes place in, because it doesnt raise the education of people already living in one plqce. the place merely becomes the location of business.

companies can claim to do 1. but they actually do 2.

people who claim 1. interpret 3. as hostility

people who think 4. can be interpreted as 3.

then 2. and 1. can unite against 4. and paint them as 3.

it should be noted that these patterns rely on a freedom and migration positive mainstream. the important point is to find different angles and misrepresent one as another to create a majority.

<h2>integration</h2>


<p>
One open question thats occasionally in the news, is how much migration should take place, who should be helped, internationally, who should be accepted under assylum rules. Part of the problem with that discussion lies with the main motivation of two participating groups:
</p>

<blockquote>
    <i>Terminology: I will use "integration" to mean: "complying with the local laws", not assimilation, not necessarily cultural integration.</i>
</blockquote>

<p>(numbered for ordering and for reference)</p>

<ul>
    <li>1.1 one position makes an argument for empathy and freedom</li>
    <li>1.2 one position makes an economical argument that "workers are needed for the economy". 
    <ul>
    <li>1.2.1 companies make the argument that it may be cheaper to attract people from other places than training new people.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>1.3 there is also "cultural enrichment" / xenophiles, who think integrating other cultures will be a benefit to society.</li>
</ul>

<p>
They are somewhat at odds with one another. Here are some composites of the opposition.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>2.1. groups that reject others based on appearance, religion, etc.. "Xenophobes" although I don't like that term.</li>
    <li>2.2. isolationist people want to be left alone, dont want to welcome new people and therefore dont want to help and then integrate people. There is also so a fear of crime and conflicts with other cultures.</li>
    <li>2.3. economic protectionist people fear the impact that more workers have on the economic value of work. Theirs or the total work.</li>
    <li>2.4. There is another, let's call them "process skeptic", they think that in principle, a side on the pro side is valid, however the integration can't actually be done due to factors. Those factors can include any of the other contra points, incompontence in any imaginable spot or a resistance to be integrated from the integratee.</li>
</ul>

<h2>risks and benefits of immigration</h2>

<p>I need a chapter for this as well.</p>

<h2>opinion disclaimer.</h2>

<p>
I think most "official" statements from political parties and companies are (1.2) and just want the economic benefit. They don't care about possible negative consequences. I think there are a large number of well meaning people who think (1.1) is the way to go, but haven't done the math or don't want to do the actual work of teaching the rules of society and who are unwilling to do policing of a required intensity to uphold the law as we have it. For fear of being viewed as racist by their peers. But also because of a general dislike for rules and rule enforcement.
</p>

<p>
On the negative side, I think there definitely are indoctrinated racists, who got fed nonsense about other people from a young age and never questioned it. There are also people who perceive problems, make conclusions and become racist. I don't think anyone is publicly making the economic protection argument. I don't think anyone is making the process sceptic argument, publicly, but it's part of what gets grouped with the accusation of racism.
</p>

<p>
As a whole, the topic is not handled as in depth as it should be. I'm not opposed to migrant workers, I think the exploitation is excessive and bad. Because of generally questionable public spending, the taxes collected from profits on that exploitation, even if it weren't excessive and merely "utilized" migrant workers, does not give back to society enough. Negative examples such as Sweden are concerning and highlight what has to be avoided if public support for immigration is to be achieved. (To be absolutely explicit here: the acceptable number of explosions because of gang warfare is zero. Not "lower than last year".)
</p>

<h2>common patterns</h2>

<p>because different interest groups want different things and want to "win" in terms of public attention, agreement, votes, perception, etc.. a lot of the conflict will rely on forming camps or seeming to form camps, to create a majority to support any particular position. This construction doesn't have to be "true" it just has to be believed to be successful, so here are some argumentative patterns that can be observed:</p>
<ul>
    <li><i>2.2 & 2.3</i>: 1.2.1 Is bad for the society it takes place in, because it doesnt raise the education of people already living in one plqce. The place merely becomes the location of business.</li>
    <li><i> 1.2 : </i> pretend to be 1.1 , frame any opposition as 2.1 <br>
    Or as a longer sentence: From a position of financial interest, claim to act as compassionate, frame all opposition to your financial interest as racist xenophobes.</li>
    <li>people who claim 1.1, interpret 2.2 and frame 2.3 as 2.1</li>
</ul>
It should be noted that these patterns rely on a freedom and migration positive mainstream. the important point is to find different angles and misrepresent one as another to create a majority.

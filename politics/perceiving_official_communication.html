<div><h2>perceiving official communication</h2>
<p>
    Whenever a politician or a ministry or even official research releases a statement, paper or whatever, there are a few possibility case distinctions that I make:
</p>

<table>
    
<tr>
    <td colspan="2" width="50%">they intentionally say what they think is true</td>
    <td colspan="2" width="50%">they intentionally say something that is not true, for external motivation reasons, like money, power, etc.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td colspan="2" width="50%">true/positive permutations</td>
    <td colspan="2" width="50%">made up or misrepresenting facts</td>
</tr>
<tr width="100%" >
    <td width="25%">true positive<br>what they say is actually true and a good idea.</td>
    <td width="25%">false positive<br>they believe what they say, but they made a methodology error and it's actually not true.</td>
    <td width="25%">complete lie</td>
    <td width="25%">complicated tangent...<br>the opposite of what they say could be true.<br>there could be a true kernel to it</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td width="50%" colspan="2">annoying third: what they say could be factually true, but they're not saying it to fix a problem or enlighten a situation, it they're saying it for personal extrinsic motivations, like popularity, votes, research funding, etc.. and they have no intention to <i>actually</i> fix the issue, they only mean to fuel a "research and talk show industrial complex" about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td width="100%" colspan="4">regardless of whether or not the thing that they publish is true, they can be saying the things that they are saying to pursue a particular "vision" of society that they think would be ideal, even if it is not something that would win a popular vote or that individuals would actually agree to if they had the choice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td  width="100%" colspan="4">Also very common is are papers that declare strategies and intentions but don't actually do anything and aren't being used in practice, they are not being used to influence other policy decisions and even if they are mentioned, they are deprioritised so much that the statement may as well have never been made.<br> E.g. "of course the environment is important, but think of the economy"</td>
</tr>


</table>

<p>
This very simply leaves us with a few basic questions:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>who are the people actually providing / creating the information?</li>
    <li>what are their motivations?</li>
    <li>what are their methods?</li>
</ul>

<p>
    It is then very obvious to see that most politicians don't care about people. They care about getting something done for themselves or for their interest group and those interest gorups are usually:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>"capitalists and rich people"<br>
    owners of bigger-ish companies, real estate, stocks, etc..
    </li>
    <li>"religious or ethnic fanatics"</li>
    <li>"international strategic / diplomatic purposes"</li>
    <li>interest groups like unions, although that's pretty rare these days, because they are usually too weak</li>
    <li>interest groups that are representing an internal political power struggle, like a police union, a military official or a political wing of a party</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div>
    <p>In other words: if someone says they plan to do something "for the environment", I expect that they actually mean they will do something for 
        <ul>
            <li>research</li>
            <li>industrial subsidies for "green tech"</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>when they say they want to do something "for the children"
        <ul>
            <li>something for a publishing company or supplier of educational "tools".</li>
            <li>something actually super authoritarian and "the children" are the most vulnerable group they can think of, to use as "a victim that needs to be protected" and trigger our empathy response to go along with whatever dark fantasy they have cooked up this time.<br>sometimes this can be "international cooperation"</li>
            <li>they are projecting their own pedo crimes on the general population and want to do it to run a distraction away from themselves.</li>
            
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>when they say, they want to do it "for the economy":
        
        <ul>
            <li>they may be trapped in a "a rising tide lifts all ships" mentality that is factually not true and wrongly conclude that more work leads to more prosperity. </li>
            <li>they actually talk about the interests of factory owners, who don't care about the environment or social situation of the location they operate in, they only care to maximize productivity, via any means they can: fear and economic pressure by reducing social security and increasing migration to create a greater pool of competing workers to lower the price of labor.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>when they say, they want to do it "to strengthen the press and freedom of the press" or "limit misinformation and hatespeech"
        <ul>
            <li>they actually have very specific publishing houses in mind that they want to subsidize.</li>
            <li>there is a particular point of view they want to suppress, which may be actually misinformation and hatespeech, but the main point is that it suppresses a political point of view that coincidentally mostly surfaces as misinformation and hatespeech. But the misinformation and hatespeech isn't the point, it's the medium. That doesn't mean that the people using hate speech to express their views shouldn't be stopped from doing that, or that I support them doing it. I don't.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

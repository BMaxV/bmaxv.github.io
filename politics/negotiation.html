it might an unfortunate or unpleasant fact, but most social constructs are a result of negotiation.

that negotiation is mostly about power.

the power to force a negotiation.

the power to ignore it.

the power to force a certain outcome.

often, we abstract positions and arguments into values and then we weigh them against each other and the stronger collection of arguments wins.

its somewhat important to recognize that there are few areas that are free of this logic. 

there are no laws around negotiations. its an adversarial conflict. plain and simple. Sun Zus rules aplly. if a move puts you in a globally better, stronger position, there is no reason to not make the move.

deception and social engineering are fair game.

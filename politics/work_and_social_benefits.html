<h1>work and social benefits</h1>
<p>
    A "social contract" is one of the bigger accomplishments of the last 200 years. But there are some fuzzy areas with certain designs of laws. And public debate and assumptions.
</p>
<div><h2>work</h2>
<p>
    Leaving out background for now.
</p>
<p>
    The current situation is that people generally are allowed to do the work they want, if they can convince an employer that they can do the work. Usually via education certification. Sometimes there are rules that require these certifications by law. Anyway, it's not a question of social status or gender or things like that, it's supposed to be meritocratic.
</p>
</div>
<div><h2>"benefits"</h2>
<p>
    Because of unpredictability, some kind of insurance that spreads risk among employees, be it for health or loss of job, has established itself as a good idea. Also union fees, if there is a union.
</p>
<p>
    With people receiving payment, the question of abuse of that system arises.
    <ul>
        <li>should this person or situation be covered?</li>
        <li>should the "benefit" be that high?</li>
    </ul>
    Because it's a big part of national budgets, it is frequently up to debate. It virtually affects everyone. So in general it's hard to come to a conclusion.
</p>
</div>
<div><h2>"the Common Social Good"</h2>
<p>
    Reading a book called "maximum feasible misunderstanding" it became obvious to me, that there is no good unified idea of what a "good society" means or how it works. And depending on those, it is not agreed upon (populistically), whether certain measures help or not.
</p>
<p>
    E.g. Is help good, or does it teach dependence?
</p>
</div>
<div><h2>core assumptions and questions</h2>
<p>
    It is generally assumed that <b>(1) "work" is available</b> and individuals are responsible for seeking it out and trying their best to work, earn money and finance the rest of the system.
</p>
<p>
    Deriving from that, a failure to have or hold a job, is the failure of the person, not the system.
</p>
<h3>standard of living under assistance</h3>
<p>
    The acceptable standard of living for those receiving assistance is uncertain. It would be easy if there was a checklist: at least 2 pairs of shoes, 5 shirts, 2 trousers, a plate and cuttlery to eat with, a fridge to eat fresh and healthy.
</p>
<p>
    What about a washing mashine? How many square meters per person is acceptable? It probably doesn't include a car, but maybe a bike? If so, what kind? Entertainment? Should the nation giving the assistance influence the kind of entertainment, for the purpose of... molding the thoughts and opinions of the people receiving the assistance or should it be completely hands off?
</p>


<div><h3>forced assistance</h3>
<p>
    How to deal with e.g. homelessness or begging? Should homeless people be collected by police and given a place to leave, but somewhere else than they choose to be and against their will?
</p>
</div>
<div><h3>economic coercion</h3>
<p>
    Let's say, a person receiving assistance gets an offer for a job, but it's not a good fit. How much pressure should be on finding a good fit and how much on getting out of assistance? Are there jobs that are socially unacceptable to force people into?
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div><h2>migration</h2>
<p>
    Market forces exist. (happy to be corrected on this) Generally speaking:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>shortage of workers should increase the value of the work and increase wages</li>
    <li>migration of workers, will decrease the value of the work in the new area and lower wages</li>
    <li>neither is necessarily the case, depending on matching specialization
    <ul>
        <li>migration of low skill workers to a high skill demand region, will not solve the high skill worker shortage and create a low skill oversupply situation</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
</div>
</body>

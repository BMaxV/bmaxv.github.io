<h2>space / real estate</h2>
<p>
One of the big questions of politics and wealth distribution, is who gets to live where. Sometimes this has a simple answer: where there is little competition and it's so useful to live in some place that you can just do it.
</p>

<p>
The other case is that there is conflict over who gets a nice place and who doesn't.
</p>

<p>One option on how to solve this, is that the place of living gets assigned.</p>

<p>The other is some kind of negotiation, for example, via a market or as a political discussion of who should live where. This has some issues and consequences:</p>

<ul>
    <li>the transport problem, of people living in one place and working in another</li>
    <li>guarantee of ownership and property, sort of guarantees property in perpetuity</li>
    <li>the uncompetitiveness of necessary services, like daycare vs. a brand clothing store</li>
    <li>transfer of taxes</li>
    <li>a market wouldn't by itself fulfill all aspects we want from a nice living space:
    <ul>
        <li>standards for materials and technique</li>
        <li>collective loss leader problem</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>We can have politics driving spacial ordering that is not in the interest of parts of the population.</li>
    <li>Possibly racial/religious/economic segregation or mixing as positive of negative, depending on what's mainstream.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="berlin">Berlin</h2>
<p>I'm living in Berlin, there is a "housing shortage" now (2023) and there are certain patterns:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The government didn't/doesn't want to and/or is incapable of building public housing.</li>
    <li>There is demand for cheap labor in the expensive city center</li>
    <li>There is a problem with the traffic caused by people (e.g. commuting to or from work)</li>
    <li>When looking at the equation of 
    <pre>Fraction = Rent / Income</pre>
    People complain that <b>rent</b> is too high, but very infrequently mention that maybe <b>income</b> isn't high enough. That's suspcious to me.</li>
    
    <li>To "solve" this, various initiatives were started, such as 
    <ul>
        <li>implementing a legal limit on raising rent</li>
        <li>selling public parks to real estate developers, but not the ones near where the high society lives.</li>
        <li>to collectivise big real estate companies and keep rent down that way.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

    <ol>
        <li>It is possible to build machines and processes that control precisely defined variables.</li>
        <li>Using surveys and correctly constructed questions, it is possible to control variables that are not precisely defined too.</li>
        <li>A feedbackloop looks like this:
        
        <center>
        <img src="full_feedback_ortho.svg">
        </center>
        
        </li>
        <li>Combined, this means any problem humanity or any individual has, can be solved by this process.</li>
        <li>The only thing that is required for that to happen, is to fully and correctly define a feedbackloop and then to use it.</li>

    <h2>What?</h2>
    <p>"Information quality management"? Sounds like some special thing for specialists, so why does this concern you?</p>
    <p>In short, Ads. Spam. Media and bad journalism. Teaching, learning, research. Voting, etc. if those concern you in any way, this topic concerns you.
    </p>
    <p>Ads are supposed to "inform" you of your choice to purchase a product. Spam for products you will never want and never buy are useless. So is seeing an ad, deciding you don't want it and then seeing it again.</p>
    <p>When you read an article or interview and you feel like something is missing, like questions that were not asked, something went wrong.</p>
    <p>I'm sure something was explained to you before or you read something and somehow it didn't 'click' with you. Some detail was missing.</p>
    <p>Talking about politics, it's not a new trick, but many politicians take extra care in their wording, to make sure it stays in that nebulous grey area: You're not quite sure what they said after they're done and what they do say can always be twisted to make sure they're eiter presented in a good light or deflect blame somehow.</p>
    <p>These are cases where you're not getting the information you need or want in the quality that you want it.</p>
    <p>That's the direction this entire thing goes in.</p>
    <p>And no, that's not just "how the world works". Because, it doesn't <b>work</b>.</p>
    <p>To make sure we're on the same page and to explain what I base all this on, I have some <a href="/backmatter/index.html">backmatter</a>. If you already know about control theory, quality managment, I would recommend to skip to it's <a href="">summary page</a>. Otherwise you might want to read my <a href="/core/arguments.html">core arguments</a> or browse my list of <a href="examples/list.html">examples</a> where things went wrong.</p>

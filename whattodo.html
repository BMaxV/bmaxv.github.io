    <h1 id="start">Finding out what to do.</h1>
    <p>The basic principle of how we deal with things in this world is by comparing an abstract ideal, theory or goal and what's actually the case.</p>
    <p>There are a number of challenges to this that I want to adress. In most cases I can see, the biggest problem is bad communication. People misunderstand, aren't precise or get sidetracked. So I aim to collect and organize some tools and easy directions and simple arguments to follow, to adress the most common errors.</p>
    <p>The split between abstract and real is easy and that's a big advantage. For example:</p>
    <table>
    <tr><th width="50%">Theory</th><th width="50%">Real</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Traffic rules are designed for safety,<br>drivers take tests.</td><td>Accidents happen anyway.</td></tr>
    </table>
    <p>When talking about how to avoid another accident, we can approach from two sides:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>something with the rules or the testing is wrong</li>
        <li>there was something else about the real situation that we need to avoid</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The best traffic rules won't help if a driver has a heart attack, and the best, healthiest drivers will cause accidents if there is something wrong with the situation created by the rules.</p>

    <h2>Hi!</h2>
    <p style="color:rgb(150,0,0);"><i>this is currently work in progress, I have the rough goal of finishing by 2021.03.30.</i></p>
    <p>this is the landing page for a writing project about the biggest thing that's wrong with the world: information quality management.</p>
    
    <p>I recommend fullscreen mode (F11 in my browser).</p>
    <p>I hope it's informative and/or entertaining!</p>
    
    <p>As a teaser, Chapter 30 of the 'hitchhikers guide to the galaxy' contains this gem:</p>
    <blockquote>"You know," said Arthur thoughtfully,  "all this explains a lot of things. All through my life I've had this strange unaccountable feeling that something was going on in the world, something big, even sinister, and no one would me what it was."<br>
        "No"," said [Slartibartfast], "That's just perfectly normal paranoia. Everyone in the Universe has that."
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>This website is my answer, what that big thing is and how to fix it. In theory.</p>

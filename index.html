    <h2>Hi!</h2>
    <p style="color:rgb(150,0,0);"><i>this is currently work in progress, I have the rough goal of finishing by 2021.03.30.</i></p>
    <p>this is the landing page for a writing project about the biggest thing that's wrong with the world: information quality management.</p>
    
    <p>I recommend full screen mode (F11 in my browser).</p>
    <p>I hope it's informative and/or entertaining!</p>
    
    <p>As a teaser, Chapter 30 of the 'hitchhikers guide to the galaxy' contains this gem:</p>
    <blockquote>
        "You know," said Arthur thoughtfully,  "all this explains a lot of things. All through my life I've had this strange unaccountable feeling that something was going on in the world, something big, even sinister, and no one would tell me what it was."<br>
        "No"," said [Slartibartfast], "That's just perfectly normal paranoia. Everyone in the Universe has that."
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>This website is my answer, what that big thing is and how to fix it. In theory.</p>
    <p>
        I have also tried my best to make it as approachable as possible. Please feel free to skip over the parts that feel familiar.</p><p>I choose to err on the stupid side, because the apparent failure is widespread, worldwide and particularly obvious where you would expect the highest levels of sophistication. Meaning, very smart people, in very high positions seem to get this wrong for reasons I can't explain.

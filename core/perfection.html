    <h3>it could be so easy...</h3>
    <p>I don't feel like I am asking for some superhuman effort. I all I want is that people use their brain a little bit before acting. To consider what can go wrong and prevent it before it can go wrong.</p>

        For media information, that would be actually mentioning the important bit. Sometimes that can be who did it, sometimes it what was being done. The important part is to get right which is which. E.g.: In case of a natural desaster, it is much more important what happened and what is being done, than who is doing it. In a case where it was unclear and the ongoing topic is about who did it, like a murder mystery, it's about who did it.

        For any kind of project that is being undertaken, to ensure everyone is informed and agrees, that the project is safe and on track. That when mistakes happen, the lessons are being learned by everyone. That the work being done actually advances the project, effectively and efficiently.

    <p>Why is that so hard?!</p>

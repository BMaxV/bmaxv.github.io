    <h3>intuitive basics of logic you already know</h3>
    <p>Elements can be combined to form longer sentences. "I have cake." and "I have tea." can be combined to "I have cake and tea." according to the rules of natural language.</p>
    <h3>slightly less intuitive basics you maybe don't know </h3>
    <p>Strictly speaking, all elements of a "sentence" must be "true", or the sentence as a whole isn't "true".</p>
    <p>
        If I say "I have cake and tea." when I really only have tea, isn't a true sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
        Following this train of thought, other combined natural languages text bodies are also not "true", when parts of it aren't true.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is kind of important for me, because bad parts in official text bodies like laws or even just journalistic articles, can draw a huge amount of attention they don't really deserve. And I am really interested in not wasting time reading articles that are like 50% not really that true or verifiable.
    </p>
    <p>
        It also becomes particularly important in cases of complicated, multi layered arguments. Especially ones that look obvious and simple at first glance, because the sentence you see is the last part of a long argument.
    </p>
    <p>
        Something like "A -> B -> C -> D -> E" and the part that's spoken out loud is just "D->E". Sometimes you have to do a fair bit of work to find out that "B" is wrong from your point of view and therefore the entire argument is nonsense.
    </p>

        Or put differently, I would really like to measure how "true" bigger natural languag text bodies, like speeches, articles and party programs are.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        A difficulty that probably creeps in is that it is difficult to evaluate if an intent is true.

    <h3>conclusions are really a mutual social promise to cooperate</h3>
    <p>
        The easiest way to illustrate this is probably math.
    </p>
    <p>
        Take "1+x=2".
    </p>
    <p>
        You would normally think that "x must be 1", because that's the kind of understanding being taught to kids in school.
    </p>
    <p>
        If I turn around and say, "nooo 'x is 3'", I'm breaking that convention. Understanding and communication between us breaks down, because "1+3=2" isn't a true sentence and makes no proper sense by itself.
    </p>
    <p>
        The point I want to make, is that in other kinds of arguments, people may be more interested in their 'local' truth, than the overall truth of the sentence. They will insist that x=3, ignoring that there is a "1+x=2" that ultimately has to mean x is something other than 3.
    </p>
    <p>
        And the same is true for "rules" that create conclusions. If someone insists that a rule can't be applied or works differently, the outcome will be different and <i>there is nothing that can be done about that.</i> You can't force anyone to <i>conclude</i> the same way as you.
    </p>
    <p>
        Instead it has to be recognized that you're no longer talking about your original issue and you have to make sure you're <i>literally</i> speaking the same language before you can proceed with any argument.
    </p>
    <p>
        This becomes a particular issue when people who already don't want to cooperate are confronted with each other and somehow think they can still convince each other, using their own sets of rules and "x=3".
    </p>
    <p>
        That doesn't mean science is wrong, but occasionally it has to be recognized that it is ineffective at dealing with an issue at hand.
    </p>

        To use a real world example, climate change deniers and people who want to do stuff to cut emissions to keep the climate stable, are probably not believing in the same basic things. And at the moment, the law and general common sense says that's totally cool, you're free to believe what you want. Legally, morally, someone's doctorate and someone's 5 minute youtube research are of equal right and value.

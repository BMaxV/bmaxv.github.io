    <h2>General basis for any kind of argument or discussion</h2>
    <p>There are some things we generally assume. Sometimes we have axioms or other basic principles we refuse to violate.</p>
    <p>In this case: there are things that should be true and there are aspects that we want the world or our lives to be like, and there are things we try to avoid.</p>
    <p>Often that's implicit in our wording. We always want to avoid accidents. By definition and our understanding of natural language, we already know that an <i>accident</i> is bad and that something went wrong that normally doesn't go wrong.</p>
    <p>And it doesn't matter where the accident happened, who it happened to or why.</p>
    <p>Avoiding accidents is a general interest shared by everyone.</p>
    <p>This kind of general interest applies to several core concepts of discussion, requirements that have to be met for discourse to take place. If you don't agree to these, I basically don't want to live in the same social construct as you.</p>

        We want things to be nice, safe, true, just, verifiable or certain. 
        We want things to work, rather than not. We want things to be efficient.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is of course very vague, but the direction is clear. 
        If there is disagreement over what any of it means in a specific case, congratulations for finding a topic that warrants deeper discussion.

        Ensuring these qualities is a basic motivation and necessity for society and I expect people to generally help that.

    <p>
        Meaning, I don't have to argue why I want people to not lie. I don't have to prove that statements are lies, others have to provide a good argument, a valid reasoning or a good source that does both instead, to convince me.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because of this, people, processes, machines, companies that don't do this, are generally more wrong than right and should be stopped rather than negotiated with, or helped. Beyond a certain point and impact, they have to justify what they do, rather than having a natural right to do what they want.

        History does not justify violation of (1).

        I don't care about the amount of sunk costs in effort, money or time. You don't get points for trying or meaning well. If the current system produces a bad result, the current system is bad and correcting or improving it should be an implicit, obvious thing to do.
    </p>
    <p>
        I also don't care about positive track records, success in 99 cases does not "erase" the failure in 1 case. People can't build up "niceness points" and cash them in when they misbehave.
    </p>

        There is a natural order to problems. Fighting the source of problems takes priority over fighting the symptoms.
    </p>
    <p>
        The solution to a burning house is not to replace that parts that are burning, while the house is still on fire. It is to fight the fire, and when that is done, to repair and rebuild.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the basic theory or operation of something produces failure, it is not a solution to compensate for the failure. The first step is ensure the theory and course of action are sound, only then can we act.

        Natural laws can't be ignored.

        A motor doesn't accept "credit"-fuel. You can't convince a process or machine to work. Either the conditions for it's correct operation are met or they're not.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you think a process or machine should produce a certain outcome, but consistently doesn't, it's not circumstances or the world in general that made your process or machine fail. You are simply wrong and the process or machine isn't built correctly. Taking circumstances into account to ensure the correct function is the duty of the designer.

    <p>All failure is the failure to formulate, archive or execute a well formed feedbackloop.</p>
    <p>That's basically what this website is about.</p>

        I'm not here to argue semantics, language isn't precise like that. Please overlook smaller mistakes or disagreements over terms and consider the bigger picture. I do appreciate polite, good quality corrections.

        Proverbially sitting down at a table to discuss things, has to mean both parties are at least somewhat willing and able to question their own beliefs and positions.
    </p>
    <p>
        It requires a cautious acceptance of positions for the duration and sake of the argument, even if they are normally "unspeakable".
    </p>
    <p>
        It also requires a willingness to be open for and supportive of new ideas. A common pattern in online discussions is to focus on a particular detail of a concept and then declaring the entire concept flawed because a detail doesn't work out as is. This is not in conflict with <a href="#1">(1)</a> and <a href="#2">(2)</a>, because shooting down ideas like that doesn't make the "counter argument" true or verifiable. Also see <a href="6">(6)</a>.

    <p>
        Natural language does a lot for us. Don't question common interpretation of words for the sake of it. Generally assume that the terms I use are meant the way dictionaries would define them. Not necessarily the way people want them to be meant for political reasons.

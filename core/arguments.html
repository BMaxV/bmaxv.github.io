    <p>There are some things we generally assume. Sometimes we have axioms or other basic principles we refuse to violate.</p>
    <p>In this case: there are things that should be true and there are aspects that we want the world or our lives to be like, and there are things we try to avoid.</p>
    <p>Often that's implicit in our wording. We always want to avoid accidents. By definition and our understanding of natural language, we already know that an <i>accident</i> is bad and that something went wrong that normally doesn't go wrong.</p>
    <p>And it doesn't matter where the accident happened, who it happened to or why.</p>
    <p>Avoiding accidents is a general interest shared by everyone.</p>
    <p>This kind of general interest applies to several core concepts of discussion, requirements that have to be met for discourse to take place. If you don't agree to these, I basically don't want to live in the same social construct as you.</p>
    <h3>1</h3>
    <p>We want things to be safe, true, just, verifiable or certain. We want things to work, rather than not. We want things to be more efficient.</p>
    
    <h3>2</h3>
    <p>Ensuring these qualities is a basic necessity for society and I expect people to generally help that.</p>
    <p>Meaning, I don't have to argue why I want people to not lie. I don't have to prove that statements are lies, others have to provide a good argument, a valid reasoning or a good source that does both instead, to convince me.</p>
    <p>Because of this, people, processes, machines, companies that don't do this, are generally more wrong than right and should be stopped rather than negotiated with, or helped. Beyond a certain point and impact, they have to justify what they do, rather than having a natural right to do what they want.</p>
    
    <h3>3</h3>
    <p>History does not justify violation of (1).</p>
    <p>I don't care about the amount of sunk costs of effort, money or time. You don't get points for trying or meaning well. If the current system produces a bad result, the current system is bad and correcting or improving it should be an implicit, obvious thing to do.</p>
    
    <h3>4</h3>
    <p>There is a natural order to problems. Fighting the source of problems takes priority over fighting the symptoms.</p>
    <p>The solution to a burning house is not to replace that parts that are burning, while the house is still on fire. It is to fight the fire, and when that is done, to rebuild.</p>
    <p>If the basic theory or operation of something produces failure, it is not a solution to compensate for the failure. The first step is ensure the theory and course of action are sound, only then can we act.</p>
    
    <h3>5</h3>
    <p>Natural laws can't be ignored.</p>
    <p>A motor doesn't accept "credit"-fuel. You can't convince a process or machine to work. Either the conditions for it's correct operation are met or they're not.</p>
    <p>If you think a process or machine should produce a certain outcome, but consistently doesn't, it's not circumstances or the world in general that made your process or machine fail. You are simply wrong and the process or machine isn't built correctly. Taking circumstances into account to ensure the correct function is the duty of the designer.</p>
    
    <h3>(6)</h3>
    <p>I'm not here to argue semantics, language isn't precise like that. Please overlook smaller mistakes or disagreements over terms and consider the bigger picture. I do appreciate polite, good quality corrections.</p>

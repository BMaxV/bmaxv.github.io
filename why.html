my father asked me why i was writing this and for whom, since i havent really shared it with anyone yet.

i think the answer is that this my attempt of a "society discourse crash dump". let me explain.

programming is a very linear thing but the computer is very fast.

if zhere is a msitake the program crashes and its up to the programmer to look at the resulting mess and figure out whst went wrong, where, why and to rewrite the program to make it not crash the next time its run.

this is the same thing except for public discourse.

so anytime i read a statement or a book or some ozher kind of media and i disagree, there is the quesrion of how, where, why we, me and the author, went different paths in our thinking.

aometimes that requires summaries of sotuations, theories or just my thoights.

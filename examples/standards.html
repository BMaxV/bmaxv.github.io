    <h3>standards</h3>
    <p>...are supposed to harmonize everything.</p>
    <p>They are supposed to ensure that that interactions are smooth, efficient and they are supposed to avoid misunderstandings.</p>
    <p>There are two ways standards come to be:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Someone does something and the way it's done is so new or so successful or their market position is so dominant, that everyone copies it (or is indirectly forced to) and it becomes the "de facto" standard.
        </li>
        <li>
            Numerous people recognize that they are doing the same thing, but differently and if only they did it the same way, things would be way better. So they decided to sit down and agree on the optimal way of doing it. It's strongly implied that they are then supposed to follow that standard.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Software is especially relevant here, because it's easy to change standards and because people are quick to do so.</p>

        That's of course because the stick figure in the comic ignores that things are <i>built</i> and then they <i>exist</i>. No matter what is being done, those things will continue to exist, built according to a potentially old standard. That's why adoption of a new standard is always difficult, even when everyone agrees that everything would be nicer if it was done only one way.
    </p>
    <h3>key complaints</h3>
    <p>
        The way that standards are being made and administrated is... wonky. Internationally it's supposed to be ISO, but there are lots of exceptions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Often, it's a weird mix of half legal stuff too, where governments write laws that say something like "has to be built according to industry standards", but it's the industry who writes the standard and who checks for compliance. When done badly, this carries the risk of there being no standard.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            there are independent organizations that just do things differently, usually because of a seeming separation of concern. Like w3, who make html. They handle different things of a different type, but that there even is a different organization making standards at all, is <i>weird</i>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                ISO standards cost money. Like... to buy. They're like the technical equivalent of laws and you <i>really</i> don't want anyone to do things differently. Earth would be a much nicer place if we could all just read and use the same standards. But no, they're prohibitively expensive for small businesses and individuals.
            </p>
            <p>
                The argument is that since companies had to come together and that cost them money, that money needs to be recouped somehow. For some super weird reason that's not done via taxes, but it's done as a private (but usually exclusive) institute, which gets and exclusive resell license. You're then supposed to buy the pdf and print it or something, I don't know.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is also the argument that the industry doing things knows those things best and is therefore in the best position to regulate it. And there is some truth to that. The problems arise when the interest of the companies and the interests of the public don't align.
            </p>
        </li>
        
    </ul>
    <p>
        I have a limited perspective on standards, obviously. There are 5 cases I want to highlight:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                To show how things can go horribly horribly horribly wrong: the standard for contact information (Vcard) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCard">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCard</a> and the event and date format <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar</a> 
            </p>
            <p>
                Basically they are <b>the</b> standard for anything relating to contact data and events. And if you ever had problems transfering contacts between mobile phones or creating an event or a meeting and inviting people. <b>Those</b> are the standards that should have solved that.
            </p>
            <p>
                By extension, the people and companies making it, are the ones who should have solved the problem and who I point my finger at every time something related to this stuff fails.
            </p>
                
        </li>
        
        <li>
            To show how nice things could be, if we just switched, the standard for a superior date time format ISO 8601 (yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss). It goes from big to small. Super simple. When you put that in a list and sort it, the list will always be in perfect cronological order. There is no reason not to do it, besides cultural ones I think.
        </li>
    
        <li>
            <p>
                To show how weird things can get, I want to highlight the "show your work" approach of shipbuilding standards. The idea here is that ships are highly specialized objects and there isn't a good way to standardize how ships should be like. Instead, it's easier to demand that the people building them prove that they're safe, by any means.
            </p>
            <p>
                And for all it's worth, that works reasonably well. Probably mostly because very rich people are interested in making sure they're not buying crap. So they're paying a lot of money to have things checked by lots of people.
            </p>
            <p>
                In practice there are a few institutions involved: The shipyard building the ship, then there is a certification society that is supposed to independently check and verify that it is built according to the rules, then the customer has a few people who are supposed to check that things are built as agreed with the customer and then down the road there are insurance companies and official institutions that will only declare the ship safe and insured when the certification society gives their ok.
            </p>
            <p>
                What's interesting about that is that they're transnational and require very little oversight. In other words, it's a case where self certification and self regulation <i>actually works</i>. Even though the result is maybe a bit convoluted and expensive. Still, you have to respect it working as well as it does. Don't fix what isn't broken.
            </p>
        </li>
    
        <li>
            <p>
                To show the opposite of working self organization: video games. I am <i>moderately annoyed</i> by this.
            </p>
            <p>
                You know how video games have been around for forever? You know how many different video games were made? By companies, trying to make the most money possible?
            </p>
            <p>
                You know how they do it? 
            </p>
            <p>
                They do it <b>ALL FROM SCRATCH</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>EVERY. SINGLE. DAMN. TIME.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                With the obvious exception of yearly installments of sports games which are mostly just copied from last year. Also there are some companies offering engines that provide some common functions, but still. In general, video game companies are <i>hilariously bad</i> at pooling resources, even though they should have the common interest on reducing complexity and maintenance costs.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is mostly annoying when it comes to how common problems are solved. I have no problem acknowledging an interest in keeping particularly exceptional things secret. For example the 3d rendering tricks and techniques that make "Journey" visually appealing or when it comes to data how "Elite: Dangerous" manages a literal galaxy of stars.
            </p>
            <p>
                But there are several common problems that come up in nearly every game and more often than not, someone recreated an inferior version from scratch: networking code, making sure objects loaded and unloaded properly, smooth dynamic loading of objects and textures, UI things, key bindings, animations.
            </p>
            <p>
                The basic techniques are easy and well known. It's a growing market, there should be every interest in making the basics as easy as possible, especially since growing automation is transitioning us to a new economic model. I just don't get it.
            </p>
            
            
        </li>
    
        <li>
            <p>
                To show that it's not just "big bad corporate" who messes this up: the open source community and Linux.
            </p>
            <p>
                Linux being the "alternative" operating system, the basis on which Android was built.
            </p>
            <p>
                The basic operating principle of the linux community is that it was started by a single man who did something that nobody at the time thought of to outlaw, so it was legal. He just virtually copied the operating principle of unix from scratch.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Because he was the single author, Linus Thorvalds could be liberal in sharing his work and allowing other people to extend it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since then, the linux community has successfully fractured itself to an unbelievable degree. Modularity and flexibility is it's blessing and it's curse. It's the plattform anyone can do anything on. But because of that, people can just walk away at virtually the first sign of trouble and create their own versions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Usually that's not done with the entire thing, but there are small disagreements and the differences lie in small but important details.
            </p>
            <p>
                The irony is that there is no interest and almost no way to reharmonize things between different parts of the community. For one, they have sometimes different interests. Even though a harmonized code base would be ideal, their local optimum serves them well.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's also important to recognize that a lot of the work is being done by volunteers, so it's unfair to <i>demand</i> they work in this direction when they have no interest to.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is also no real practical way to communicate any possible harmonization, because each community has developed or picked their own communication platform. Sometimes it's done via email, sometimes via a dedicated tracking platform, though of course not with the same formats. To even enable "nice" cross communications would be a huge project in and of itself.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the biggest underlying principles of open source is that software is written and problems are solved so other people don't have to. But when the communities are fragmented like this, duplicates are guaranteed, simply because one solution doesn't conform to a standard or language required in a different community.
            </p>

    </ul>
    <h3>closing for this section</h3>
    <p>
        It should be obvious from what I have written so far how these relate to information quality control.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are things that obviously don't serve public interest and should be solved better. There are obviously things that could be centralized and streamlined.
    </p>
    <p>
        Obviously people should be talking to each other.
    </p>
    <p>
        I recognize how and why people aren't, but come on...

    <h2>what?</h2>
    <p>
        hmmm... so it might be a bit of a challenge to convince you that this is related to the main theme of the site.
    </p>
    <p>
        I consider garden architecture from basically the victorian area to be the pinnacle of environment design, as long as the goal is to create a comfortable, *obviously* designed environment. In other words, it doesn't look completely natural.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ok, but what is it? In short, it's using the given area to create an area of small forests, and meadows, with interweaving paths and designed view axes to landmarks.
    </p>
    <p>
        The paths are designed in a way that a comfortable stroll takes the average person about five to ten minutes to the next intersection. Intersections are either designed as branches or irregular stars, diverging roccocco like curves. Only very rarely will there be a crossroads and never at a right angle.
    </p>
    <p>
        Paths always curve a bit, to gradually reveal the next bit of the garden, until when a viewpoint is reached, seemingly coincidentally, in the distance you can see, a selection of things, like a statue, a plaza, a cafe, a castle, a ship pier, and the like. If something like this is also placed at this viewpoint, it naturally becomes a part of a web of interesting viewpoints.
    </p>
    <p>
        The feeling of walking through one of these well maintained gardens, with a friend, in discussion and gradually revealing the landscape, possibly as your discussion progresses, is unlike anything else.
    </p>
    <h2>the very limited examples</h2>
    <p>
        I say "garden architecture"; but I have very specific ones in mind:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>the gardens in and around Potsdam</li>
        <li>the lakes surrounding Stralsund although to a lesser degree</li>
        <li>the Alster Lake in Hamburg, although that's more of a path around the lake, which rather naturally brings view axes, because open water doesn't obstruct the view.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>why this is related</h2>
    <p>it's design.</p>
    <p>
        So, obviously those parks are great. The thing is, the same can be done with roadlayout and the design of public places.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is obviously the "american" grid layout to cities, which is easy to navigate, but has to have some disadvantages. I can't imagine managing the winds to be easy.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is the "european" style of cities that have mostly grown around a city center and while sometimes extensions were designed, there is no completely "design guide" for the whole thing, since tastes have changed over time. Which is fine too. The result can be ugly at times, but more importantly it can create an imbalance between efficient traffic and being a comfortable place to live.
    </p>
    <p>
        Anyway, it should be possible to create spaces in cities that are equal to those parks. Spaces that feel nice to live in, that don't obstruct traffic and that give a special feeling when exploring them.
    </p>
    <h2>the issue</h2>
    <p>
        Design of city layout is not discussed in public. It is simply not up for debate. Laws are made to rebuild or redesign an area, there is a public offer being made and companies design solutions and then there is a committee that decides according to unknown rules which is the best design.
    </p>
    <p>Effectively, no public consultation takes place.</p>
    <p>
        I have a problem with that, because I find most public places that have been designed in the past... oof 60 years? ugly.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>they are often designed for cars or commerce</li>
        <li>little attention is given to integrating plants, which I feel naturally add to the levels of comfort.</li>
        <li>they look like they're designed to be minimum effort to clean as a first priority, then profitable as a second and then comfortable as a third. Which, usually isn't achieved.</li>
        <li>the design of surrounding buildings is often as purpose-neutral as possible, so that they can house either retail or gastronomic businesses. That's bad, because a space that is well designed to house a cafe is entirely different from a space that is designed to sell things.
        </li>
        
    </ul>

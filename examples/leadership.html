Leadership in general is supposed to be the function that effectively combines the people that are being 'lead'. Sometimes a part of that can be expressing a feeling, opinion or plan and being "visionary". Sometimes it just means executing on a good plan or concept effectively.
</p>
<p>
Putting it differently it's about <i>getting somewhere</i>. Just staying static and not doing anything in particular isn't leadership.
</p>
<p>
I am writing about it here, because I feel neither has been done particularly well in my lifetime.
</p>

<p>
In reference to the overarching topic of quality management, leaders are supposed to be the people that make it happen. If something fails, it's their fault by default. They are the people that are supposed to decide and to be able to decide they are supposed to be informed. They are in charge of the resources and they have the responsibility to spend them in a way that enables their own function and the function of the people they lead.
</p>
<p>
Historically there have been some particularly awful leaders.
</p>
<p>
For various reasons, they got their positions anyway, kept them and caused significant damage to the people they lead.
</p>
<p>
It would be of interest to humanity in general to identify those circumstances, to be able to effectively prevent awful leadership.
</p>
<p>
There was more here and I don't think it's useful to publish that right now.

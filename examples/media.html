    <h3>Focus</h3>
    <p>
        I frequently see or read or hear "news" and it really turns out to be not "news" at all. Either becomes it's nothing or because it's qualitatively so bad I can't trust it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Say, for example, there is a current crisis on going and the "news" spends 5 minutes telling you how some ministers have convened this afternoon to discuss the situation. Which tells you; absolutely nothing. Nothing new anyway:
    </p>
    <p>
        They're still discussing, so they're not <i>doing</i> anything right now. It's an ongoing crisis, <i>of course</i> they were going to convene <i>eventually</i> and <i>of course</i> they were going to <i>discuss it</i>. Those aren't the important parts. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The important bit of news I actually want is, when they have finished their discussion, I want to know their conclusion and how they arrived at it.
    </p>
    <h3>"News" can't be neutral</h3>
    <p>
        Most topics in our news deal with some failure or flaw, exceptions are celebrations and the weather. It's mostly scandals and tragedies unfolding though. Most of the time, that implies some kind of political positioning.
    </p>
    <p>
        The whole debacle about Epstein is probably a good example:
    </p>
    <p>
        Nobody or no news outlet in their right mind would ever officially defend  pedophiles publicly. A court of law can determine if the accusation is true and the appropriate punishment, but there is a very clear implication associated with all the news: That if the accusation is true, there is a social obligation to denounce the criminal, to shun him and his closer, in the know associates.
    </p>
    <p>
        The same is basically true for all other news too, though less obvious and to a lesser extent. Sometimes people try to use the media via interviews to influence the public as described, to harm their opponents and in doing so, to help themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
        Anyway, the point being that talking about a political problem always implies questioning the action of politicians or lack thereof.
    </p>
    <p>
        This has a certain 'narrative limit'. If a news source frequently talks about some politician or party and failed projects or bad comments, the intention is pretty clear. More so, if nothing is being done about solving the problems that are being caused, the topic becomes stale.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's basically [Party or Person is bad and should be stopped] and then a possibly growing list of unresolved issues and grievances.
    </p>
    <p>
        I don't care when things are added to the list. Worse, it's often not a list at all, it's presented as "new and exciting" incidents that <i>truly</i>  show you how wicked Voldem... ehm.
    </p>
    <!--
    <p>
        Especially for the latter part, it's basically required that whatever news source it is, gives some kind link to the full official source so that it can be double checked. For some reason this is almost never done.
    </p>
    -->
    <h3>(new) fact checking sources</h3>
    <p>
        Something that's come up in the past decade is the idea of "fact checking", implying that some vague or opinionated statement isn't true according to "real facts".
    </p>
    <p>Something I see frequently being done follow this formula:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>fact check: "we're going to check A"</li>
        <li>fact check: "B"</li>
        <li>fact check: "C"</li>
        <li>fact check: "B+C->A"</li>
        <li>fact check: "therefore A"</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Although that's not necessarily true. All that's been done is introducing some arguments B and C, that may be true or completely made up. If we could trust those, maybe we can trust the conclusion, but usually there are no sources provided for B and C and we either believe the "fact check" or we don't.
    </p>
    <p>
        But that actually doesn't do anything for us. If we want to believe something arbitrary from some start or not, we can just do that. We can just trust A to be true or false, instead of trusting "fact check" first and then following it's non verifiable conclusion to true or false.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is a part of the reason, why "just breaking into news/fact checking" can't be done. Trust has to be built first and could then occasionally be used to skip the source step. It can't be a requirement to <i>first</i> trust a source, follow it's conclusion and then having to accept whatever it presents as true, to be actually true, to conclude some argument.
    </p>
    <h3>state of the art</h3>
    <p>
        That doesn't mean <b>THE</b> news shouldn't be paid attention to. Taken together they will probably have some important bits in there.
    </p>
    <p>
        But it's a significant problem that adding more "sources" doesn't actually solve any trust problem, it just creates more noise, more inputs that have to be verified and trusted first. Even if they are doing good work.
    </p>

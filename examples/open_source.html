    <h1>Open Source</h1>
    <p>
        Unlike other examples mentioned, open source isn't always a centrally managed... thing. It's a movement, of mostly individually and independently acting individuals.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, in this case, it's not as much about there being an authority that runs the feedback loop, instead, the entire thing working somewhat relies on every member having the knowlegde and awareness to perform it without external motivation or instruction.
    </p>
    <p>
        To a degree this works very well.
    </p>
    <p>
        The entire ecosystem originates from people "giving back", releasing their software free of charge and with the intention to increase the freedom everyone by providing tools. They have their own goals, solve it with code and then release the code so that other may reach their goals as well.
    </p>
    <p>
        Where it breaks down is fragmentation. There are too many linux distributions to reasonably count. There are dozens of different languages, ways to distribute code and binaries, forums, bug trackers, UI frameworks, concepts and approachs to different problems. But also there are lots of similar solutions for similar problems whose creators simply don't cooperate.
    </p>
    <p>
        The diversity of options is sometimes an illusion, because it's unreasonable to pick a particular solution that doesn't fit into the already built environment of a setup. Sometimes there are tools and frameworks that end up solving the same problem, in a way that looks similar from an outside perspective, but on the inside they differ so much in their method that they can't be switched out and often can't be merged.
    </p>
    <p>
        What ends up happening is that issues are encountered, documented and solve multiple times in their respective frameworks. The goal is no longer solving the problem at all, it's solving it in the constraints of the chosen framework. Often this ends up being complicated enough by itself, there is not enough interest outside of the group who really does the solving. The software is released, but at most helps the framework it's released in.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's a shame.
    </p>
    <p>
        As actual examples go, here are the bug trackers of Arch, Ubuntu and Debian, all of which are mostly independent. Their websites simply don't mention cooperation with other distros about harmonizing or merging code or interfaces, so I'm just going to assume they largely don't do it.
    </p>
    <p>
        That doesn't mean what they're doing isn't a great service to everyone. It is. But they have the same weakness as all the other examples.

    <h1>teaching newcomers</h1>
    <p>
        I think the linux community as a whole is doing a particularly bad job of welcoming newcomers. Not only due to individual bad behavior, but also as a whole and in a "mode of thinking" kind of way.
    </p>
    <p>
        E.g. to me, the most natural approach to things is to open things up if I can or ask the questions, what is that, what does it do and why is it there. And for the most part, those questions are unanswered by themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
        The trivial answer and the answer you will most commonly get is to read the manpage, or to look it up online, which usually also does nothing to answer the question(s).
    </p>
    <p>
        For individual tools, what can be found is build instructions, configuration hints that will help the experienced, but not the newcomer. But no basic information about the thing.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are also the homepages for entire distributions or self build projects that don't really make sense without already built background knowledge. E.g.
        
        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/index.html">http://linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/index.html</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://kernelnewbies.org/">https://kernelnewbies.org/</a></li>
        </ul>
        
    </p>
    <p>In other words, that kernelnewbies offers a tutorial on the first kernel patch is nice, but I have no actual context what that means when I first visit the site. <a href="https://kernelnewbies.org/FirstKernelPatch">link</a>. It's like learning you can switch a light switch as a blind person.</p>

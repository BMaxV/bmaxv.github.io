lack of personality and different uses between T1 and T2 and bots/tanks.

hover crosses water -> water needs to be impassible at times
spider can climb ledges

uef is a bike ans gets speed

then maybe one with a radius, one with a cone, and one with smaller radius but very cheap and spammy, also some kind stealth/hide mechanic.

artillery had not a lot of range

scout-> big scouting radius maybe message delay.

tank/troup carrier?

big economic differences between personal effort, horses, carts, ships.
--------
build bar based scaled where i can increase spending in percent

on different projecta and categories..

"storming" a position is to concentrate more force at a point than thr defense can handle.

ww1 was an isues because there was no weak spot where defenses had "low bullet throughput".

e.g. *one* single dude with a long range, high vision, slow reload gun can cover an area with x/rounds per minute.

solutiom, being 10x the number.

in medieval fantasy it wouldnt really work like tgat? except on defense. or people with crossbows.

_--------

create requests for tech or wrokers when it comes up.

e.g. long cumbersome walk? wish i had a horse/cart
doing worj alone? wish i had some help.

infrastrucutre replaxement strategy. DEFINE dsitrict makeup.
single room multipurpose buildings- > specialized that are better for tasks but useless for other things.

small workshops -> manufactories.
higher part variety -> efficiency per part+transport cost

higher tier buildings arent more resource efficient directly.

theyre more efficient because they are denser. and require less resources to protect. so hovel:1 money per person, house 1.5 money per person but fits 2 people.

-----

repairing and maintenance is often not worth it.
i could do that component based
and replace the wooden parts frequently?

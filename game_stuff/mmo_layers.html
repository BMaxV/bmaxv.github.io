<h2>mmo layers</h2>
<p>
The "living world" mmo remains illusive, but tempting.
</p>
<p>
Here is my little theory of what necessary ingedients are:
</p>
<p>
<ol>
	<li>
	It has to exist and be playable (duh)
	</li>
	<li>
	There needs to be something to do. it can be almost anyrhing but repetitiveness shpuld be limited.
	</li>
	<li>
	There needs to be some long term goal, be it a big bad that needs to be defeated or something else.
	</li>
	<li>
	There needs to be a social strucutre and gameplay that strongly encourages that it forms "naturally".
	<br>
	e.g. wow classes complementing each other to make tedious or difficult things easy.
	</li>
	<li>
	It needs real player interaction where playing with the same group benefits you for some reason hopefully without being locked in.
	</li>
	<li>
	trading
	</li>
	<li>
	It needs to give "enough" "real choices" in terms of how to build the character.
	</li>
	<li>
	The whole thing needs a hook, like wow had the character build up of wc3.
	</li>
	<li>
	Passing time and death are important story telling moments and turning points. if characters cant die, there is no risk and no tension.
	</li>
	<li>
	(x.1) type variety introduces new problems of identification, valuation and selling
	</li>
</ol>

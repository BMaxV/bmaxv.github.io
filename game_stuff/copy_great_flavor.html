        <h2>Copy Great Flavor</h2>
        <p>Two of my favorite games are FTL and eve online</p>
        <p>eve online more for what it could be than it is and FTL because it's the single most perfect package of pure flavor sprinkled game fun that exists.</p>
        <h2>FTL</h2>
        <p>for those who don't know, here is the WTF is</p>
        <center>
        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P-SnIhpCm5w" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

        <p>The thing it does so well is it translates a vague idea of space adventure that exists in the mainstream mind, into a bunch of feature details that make it feel real. For example: Beaming. Losing Power. Being in an unknown place and losing sensors. Strange hostile aliens. Strange friendly aliens. Strange encounters that hurt or benefit you for reasons you don't understand. Critical loss of atmosphere due to hull breaches. Hostile boarding parties. Running out of fuel and activating your distress beacon. Diverting power from life support shields because YOU REALLY NEED THEM.</p>
        <p>The thing that is sort of surprising about is, it basically took popular scifi as an instruction manual and turned it into game features. And apparently that's super hard and super rare. You'd think it wouldn't be, but it is.</p>
        
        <p>for comparison, here is lighting the beacons in Lord of the Rings</p>
        
        <p>And here is lighting a cyno beacon in eve online.</p>
        
        <p>There is no pop. There is no nothing. It's a few sparkles that completely undersell how epic the moment could be.</p>
        
        <p>So I would like to encourage more copying of great moments and fun atmosphere from other places. Or "meme"like  or dumb fun stuff. Not necessarily exactly quoting, but why not. People who want to have that kind of fun, will see it and celebrate it.</p>
        
        <p>People who don't... what are they even playing video games for? They're probably not going to be great cinema. They're probably not going to be great literature. Everyone into them probably knows that. Most classics so far have glaring problems in some way or another. FTL is "low detail", very linear and offers</p>

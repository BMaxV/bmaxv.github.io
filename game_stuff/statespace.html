        <h2>Strategy and state space</h2>
        <p>Strategy is a big picture plan to achieve goals. It differs from tactics mostly by scale.</p>
        <p>Strategy is implemented using tactics.</p>
        <p>Thinking about "states" or "phases" is a core part of strategies. A strategy tries to achieve particular states and transition between them in ways that serve the goal of the strategy.</p>
        <p>I think this is very useful in explaining how "real time strategy" games become "real time tactics" games when the "meta" strategy has been figured out. I don't want to play tactics games though, I want to play strategy games.</p>
        <p>I strongly recommend Day9s videos on basic starcraft strategy if it's not clear what I mean by this. To sum them up, the matchups of the three factions have shown over time to favor different selections from the big roster of units each faction has. Transfered to chess, it would mean that different pieces are more or less valuable and preferable depending on who you're playing against.</p>
        <p>The issue is, once the specific selection is known, everything else depends on execution and tactics and sometimes just luck.</p>
        <p>This can still be fun, but it's not the same thrill you get when you're figuring out what works and why.</p>
        <h3>Stellaris is not a strategy game.</h3>
        <p>The choices available in a stellaris game are pretty limited. Settling new systems and planets is almost always a good idea, since they grow population which gathers resources and accelerates the growth curve.</p>
        <p>Investing all economy into research has low risk, since early game agression is difficult, and the exponential power growth of research overpowers pays dividends soon enough and can overpower every other play style.</p>
        <h3>Age of Empires IV replicates the same <i>type</i> of state space as stracraft</h3>
        <p>...which makes it not interesting in the long run. Or at least "equally" interesting to existing products in the market, but with a smaller community, smaller network effect, less fair games because of smaller pool for match making, etc..</p>
        <p>Thus it's not surprising me to see AoE fairly low in concurrent players. It was probably successful enough via sales, but it's far away from the longevity of starcraft, which was probably the goal.</p>
        
        <h3>Why mention this at all?</h3>
        <p>Again, it's a useful tool that transfers well into any other area with goals and strategies.</p>
        <p>If a strategy is "cheese" and ends up in a state space dead end, outside of games, it's a bad or malicious strategy. Recognizing and preventing their use would be good.</p>

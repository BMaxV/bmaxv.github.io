        <h2>What?</h2>
        <p>Games fascinate me. They are a precisely defined abstraction of the real world. They are an exceptionally good tool: 
        <ul>
            <li>They are safe 
            <p>there is no impact on the real world besides the conclusions or fun we draw from them. They allow almost unlimited what-ifs, which is a good starting point to discuss and probe real issues.</p>
            <p>They make it easy and risk free for people to take on certain roles and the strong enforcement of the rules by the machine allow a "devils advocate" to really explore all options.</p>
            </li>
            <li>The concept of a game forces simplification
            <p> The established concepts of the game states "win" or "loss" provide a good foundation for any argument. Being made into a game forces an abstraction and interacting with the game allows for lots of contact with, and hopefully understanding of, the abstraction. This allows for better judgement of that abstraction.
            </p>
            <p>Faced with the simplification, it is much easier to critique the abstraction. E.g. A certain behavior is "wrong" because "in reality it works like this". Where people don't have the prompt to articulate a certain behavior otherwise.</p>
            
            </li> 
            <li>They are fun
            <p>Interacting with a topic is much easier to justify if it's fun. A simple but powerful advantage.</p>
            </li>
            <li>They are low cost and easy to copy and access
            <p>While this is theoretically true for all digital media, this advantage is neglected. Game developers have an incentive to keep their little abstraction up to date, functional and to remove inconsistencies over time.</p>
            
            </li>
            <li>There is a big, active community
            <p>Given a large enough audience, statistically, all problems will surface, all options will be explored and evaluated.</p></li>
            
            </ul> </p>
            <p>Real time strategy games in particular give a common citizen a problem set that was largely reserved for academic excercises and the literal rulers of a country. A very small group.</p>
            <p>People probably always have second guessed their leaders choices. Games offer the opportunity to explore the same scenario yourself. If the abstraction is good enough to replicate the original problem.</p>
            
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>A critique of how a particular game works or doesn't work is sometimes also an opinion on the abstracted real world concept.</p>
        <h2>Games to look at</h2>
        <p>Several games present an evolution of the genre. To make a meaning and interesting contribution, it is necessary to pick certain aspects and improve upon them.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Age of Empires</li>
        <li>Starcraft</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        <li>Supreme Commander</li>
        <li>Europa Universalis</li>
        <li>Stellaris</li>
        </ul>

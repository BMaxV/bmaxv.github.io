<h2>The acronym dry</h2>
<p>"Don't repeat yourself" is the unspoken core idea of programming. The aim is just that. The reason being that writing something is a time expensive task and it is nearly always preferable to reference something else.</p>
<p>The same is true for many other topics of writing, discussion and thinking.</p>
<p>Actually ordering all this and putting it into an appropriate shape will be difficult, I will mostly put things on here in an unorganized fashion and try to build a network between different ideas afterwards.</p>
<h2>Dry stuff</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>We're in trouble. We're story tellers, so let's try to start with that. Throughout history we have this world view of more or less centralized power in the hands of a few individuals. While this hasn't necessarily changed in democracy, the dynamics have become more complex, are difficult to observe.</p>
<p>More importantly the story we were telling ourselves about humanity as these enlightened beings, who would seek out knowledge, information and truth has received a bit of a dampener.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the core ideas of our society are modeled around it. Meaning a "parliament" only makes sense if you believe people actually talk and listen and the good argument will win. Otherwise it's just a more cumbersome representation of a fairly static and tribal power structure, held up, in the end, by nothing but association and violence.</p>
<p>In this sense this page is a desparate attempt and hope to summarize what we know and to appeal to those who can listen and understand to band together.</p>
<p>I am aware of the shitty implications, believe me.</p>

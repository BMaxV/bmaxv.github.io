    <h3>statements</h3>
    <p>
        Something that can be "seen" is that, making really good statements or speeches or texts is really really hard. I think it's generally underestimated just how hard it is. It is this difficult because being succint and detailed enough at the same time, requires a lot of thinking about word choice and what actually is the thing to be said.

        I made this data format to split things up and really look at them in detail.

    <p>The idea being that, since statements are composed of smaller statements as I wrote about in <a href="../core/logic.html#composition">the logic section</a>, individual parts of the statements can and should be isolated.</p>

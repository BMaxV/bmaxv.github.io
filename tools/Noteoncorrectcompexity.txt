I think if you made a graph of
Requirements and solutions
The "correct" path is the one that 
Puts all the requirements at the top
And solves as many as possible in as few
Steps as possible.

Doing type checking in python would be worse
Than doing it in C because the type system is
Core to how c is written and only an after thought
In python.

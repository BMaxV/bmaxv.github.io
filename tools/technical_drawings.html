    <h3>technical drawings</h3>
    <p>I think the format to do technical drawings in should be svg/html for these reasons:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>it's text based</li>
        <li>it's machine readable</li>
        <li>it's easy to edit manually</li>
        <li>it supports links and comments</li>  
        <li>it's printable</li>
        <li>it's supported by virtually every device</li>
        <li>it has a very small memory footprint</li>
        <li>it's supported by lots and lots of software, for editing, viewing and analysis</li>
        <li>it supports "real" measurements such cm, mm, directly</li>
        <li>it supports every type of line or filling styles you could want</li>
        <li>it supports grouping and inheritance</li>
        <li>you can extend it in any way you want</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As long as you want something to be 2d, that should tick all boxes.</p>
    <p>That anyone uses other formats, or even pays for it, is <b>so weird!</b></p>
    <p>Using html could look like <a href="example_document.html">this</a>.</p>

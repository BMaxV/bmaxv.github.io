    <h3>Project Management</h3>
    <p>These tools are motivated by me encountering problems and not being able to deal with them effectively. Be it because the necessary tool didn't exist or because I didn't have access to it.
    </p>
    <p>
        I will probably release them as open source eventually, because I really just want everyone to not have these problems anymore. Sooner or later they're bound to be my problem as well.
        Be it by others spending "opportunity cost" time on it, or because not using them, or tools like them, actively creates problems.
    </p>
    <h3>dependency management</h3>
    <p>
        Suppose there is a chain of people working on something and they had over stuff. 
    </p>
    <img src="./simple1.svg">
    
    <p>
        And supposed A notices he made a mistake, but it's already in C's hands. There should be a way to inform everyone up to who handles it at the time, of the issue. But not beyond.
    </p>
    <img src="./simple2.svg">
    
    <p>When it's not just one chain but a network of people working on something, you want everyone to be informed that's in the dependency tree.</p>

    <p>That should be a very very simple, interaction. Of course that depends there being an organization chart for the project and stakeholders. What I have handles the network aspect, but not the actual message sending, that's up to the user of the library.</p>
    
    <h3>time management / Gantt</h3>
    <p>
        It should be trivial, but I've noticed that it's somehow still inaccessible to just do simple time management sometimes. This tool can create the chart below but calculateing backwards in time.
    </p>
    <p>Starting by defining end date and project name and then a top down definition of the different steps.</p>
